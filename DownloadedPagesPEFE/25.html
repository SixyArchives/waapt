<p></p><h2>Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<ul ><li> Starly [#396]
</li><li> Staravia [#397]
</li><li> Staraptor [#398]
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Notable Biology</h2>
Starly are small Flying Pokemon that are mainly found in the Sinnoh region,  though wanderers have been spotted in Kanto. They are known for living in large noisy focks that move around looking for food throughout their habitat. These flocks are made up of hundreds of individuals and often undulate over a food source. Starly are also known to compete with Pidgey and other Starly flocks for food,  and are considered pests in some areas.
<p></p>Staravia are larger than Starly,  but also live in flocks. Staravia have foward-facing eyes to intimidate prey and a floppy feather crest. They are more predatory than Starly and live mostly on Bug Pokemon,  though Staravia that are close to evolution may kill and eat a Bidoof. If two Staravia flocks collide,  they will fight for territorial dominance,  with the losing flock moving elsewhere. They are also known for fighting with Pidgeotto on the rare occasions that they meet,  with the more physically robust Staravia normally winning.
<p></p>Staraptor are apex predators and generally live solitary lives. Staraptor generally stand at 3'11" and are capable of carrying a human being if so inclined. Their strong leg and wing muscles allow them to carry away a large variety of prey,  and their talons are sharp enough to scratch iron,  making them among the strongest of Flying Pokemon in terms of physical strength. Few Staravia reach this stage,  and the ones that do immediately leave their flock. They are also quite agressive,  and will attack enemies much bigger than themselves. Staraptor are also very quick flyers,  though not as quick as Pigeot or Swellow.
<p></p><h2>Habitat</h2>
Starly and Staravia are found inside forests and fields. Staraptor can be found in a variety of environments,  including deciduous forests,  conifer forests,  wetlands,  mountains,  and grasslands.
<p></p><h2>Diet</h2>
Starly eat mostly berries,  nuts,  and small insects. Staravia eat Bug Pokemon such as Kricketot,  Burmy,  Mothim,  and Wormadam. They may also occasionally eat other Pokemon such as Bidoof or Rattata. Staraptor will eat anything they can catch,  including decent sized Pokemon such as the occasional Stantler or Miltank,  though they generally prefer to kill what they can carry away,  which happens to be a lot. They hunt by flying above their prey,  diving down,  and killing it with their beaks or talons. Then the Staraptor will either eat it on the spot,  or will carry it unto a perch to eat if it's light enough.
<p></p><h2>Hazards</h2>
Starly and Staravia do not pose much of a threat to humans,  though flocks will attack what they consider to be a threat. These attacks will leave a person covered in peck marks and scratches,  but otherwise unharmed.
<p></p>Staraptor are generally uninterested in humans as prey,  though there are unconfirmed reports of Staraptor killing and carrying away small children to eat when food is scarce. They are also very aggressive,  territorial,  and are much stronger than most other Pokemon of their size,  so they are not to be trifled with. Their feet can break an arm,  their claws can rip open a human's chest,  and they can create massive whirlwinds by beating their wings. Those wings can also hit a human with enough force to break a rib cage. [[Trainer's Note: For this reason,  it is unadvised to approach a wild Staraptor if you don't have any strong Electric or Ice types to protect you.]]
<p></p><h2>Courting and Hatchling Care</h2>
Mating is done by either Staraptor or Staravia. The latter mate by fighting for females,  whereas the former do a mating dive after an endurance test. Both Staravia and Staraptor care for their young until they are capable of flying,  at which point the fledgling Starly leave to join a flock.
<p></p><h2>Social Structure</h2>
Starly and Staravia live in large flocks with hundreds of members. If they are separated from their flock,  they will cry loudly to gain a response. [[Trainer's Note: Be sure to train your Starly or Staravia out of this habit,  or you'll find yourself evicted by angry neighbors]] Staraptor live either by themselves or with a mate,  with the trainer taking up that spot if unavailible. They are known to catch small Pokemon for their Trainer's to eat,  making them very useful for lost travelers and falconers.

<p></p><span style='font-size:144%'>Bagon Line</span>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Bagon [371]
</li><li> Shelgon [372]
</li><li> Salamence [373]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Bagon line are draconic creatures that share little in common beyond a color scheme,  the presence of bony growths covered by keratin scales not unlike the shells of chelonid Pokémon such as Squirtle,  and a lack of tolerance for cold temperatures.
<p></p>Bagon are tailless bipedal reptiles with a seemingly unshakable fixation on flight that stand on average 60 centimeters high. Bagon are famous for their incredibly durable grey-scaled bony "helmets" that begin at the intersection of its large round snout with the region in between its eyes and continues until a region located roughly along its shoulders. The rest of a Bagon's body is covered with blue scales,  barring a region on the underside of its snout,  small regions around its ears,  and a region beginning at its abdomen and terminating shortly beyond its posterior that is covered in yellow scales. A Bagon has arms that lack defined digits,  but rather end in points that are capable of using claw-based attacks in captivity with great difficulty,  and feet with two digits each. A Bagon's teeth are sharp,  though small and inconspicuous,  with the very visible exception of two large,  exposed fangs located along the hinge of its lower jaw.
<p></p>The first evolution of Bagon,  Shelgon,  is a tailless,  quadrupedal creature standing roughly 110 centimeters tall,  whose features,  barring four exposed legs,  and a semi-enclosed face and posterior,  are fully encapsulated in a thick and heavy bony shell with six plates arranged in the rough form of a hexagonal prism of the same color and consistency as a Bagon's "helmet." Shelgon are also distinguished by their gray skin,  the presence of red ridges running along the back of its four legs which terminate in sharp,  rigid points,  and the presence of yellow sclera,  unlike the white sclera of both its initial and final form. While not readily visible,  the teeth on a Shelgon are larger than those of their younger bretheren.
<p></p>The final evolution of Bagon,  Salamence,  is a quadrupedal dragon that stands approximately 150 centimeters in height with two wings and three pairs of spike-like protrusions from the side of its head. Like its younger counterparts,  Salamence also have regions of their body covered by bony armor,  namely the underside of their jaw and its underbelly,  though its armor in markedly thinner than that of its younger counterparts. The rest of a Salamence's body is dominated by blue scales,  with red scales present along the the entirety of its wings,  the front of its neck,  the underside of its tail,  two ridges along the top of its head and ridges running along the length of the rear of its upper forelegs and front of its upper rear legs. Each of a Salamence's four legs sports three large and sharp claws,  which it uses in battle and in attacking prey. Like Shelgon,  Salamence have large,  but unexposed fangs with a pair of particularly prominent fangs located on the upper and lower jaw.
<p></p>In exceedingly rare circumstances,  there have been documented cases of members of the Bagon line having green scales. Due to the rarity of Bagon in general and the immense power of their final form,  these individuals are highly sought after and are known to command a hefty premium among black market traffickers.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>Like several other Pokémon with a similar physiology,  all members of the Bagon line have bladders that capture lighter-than-air and flammable gases produced by bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract,  enabling them to use fire-based breath attacks such as Ember. Bagon have by far the smallest and least developed bladder,  which contributes to the relative lack of power of their breath attacks and preference for more physically-oriented attacks. Shelgon have two bladders,  one specifically to fuel its breath attacks and one to help its legs hold up its weight,  not unlike air bladders used for buoyancy among certain marine Pokémon,  which transfers excess gases over to the other bladder. Salamence have a more developed version of Shelgon's twin gas bladders,  and have a support bladder that is capable of allowing its wings to support its body weight in mid-flight while laying waste to fields and mountainsides with incendiary breath attacks. Damage or tears in the bladder linings are not unheard of,  and can cause the breath attacks of members of the Bagon line to become erratic and impair the ability of Shelgon and Salamence to support their own weight while moving until they heal properly.
<p></p>All stages of the Bagon line have a nigh-fanatical fixation with flying. The youngest stage,  Bagon,  is infamous for its attempts at flying in the wild by diving off of high ledges near its den,  which can result in injury or death if one of the creatures overestimates the strength of its bony "helmet." Wild Shelgon also tend to live close to tall ledges,  but seldom dive off of cliffs after their first attempt after evolution due to a risk of rolling over and becoming stranded. Both wild and captive Salamence routinely fly,  and enjoy performing complex mid-air aerobatics. Being physically unable to fly,  often from a broken wing or damaged gas bladder,  is often a traumatizing experience for the dragons,  and individuals have been known to sink into deep depressions until they are once again capable of fight.
<p></p>All stages of the Bagon line are cold-blooded,  which makes them ill-adjusted to cold weather. In cold seasons or sudden cold snaps,  it is not unheard of for members of the Bagon line to set fire to plant material in order to attempt to keep warm. In extreme circumstances,  there have been reports of large groups of Bagon and its brethren defying conventional behavioral patterns to huddle en masse in an attempt to stay warm.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>While rare,  stable populations of Bagon have been recorded living in caves and in mountainous regions. Although individual Shelgon and Salamence have occasionally been spotted in the wild near areas known to house Bagon,  there are no known stable wild populations for either species of Pokémon with the exception of a population of Shelgon introduced to the area around the Johto Safari Zone.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>All stages in the Bagon line have predominantly carnivorous diets. Salamence appear to have the most carnivorous diet,  with consumption of berries or other forms of plant matter recorded only among individuals in captivity or severely malnourished individuals in the wild. Bagon and Shelgon both also have primarily carnivorous diets,  though both have been recorded eating berries and plant matter on a semi-infrequent basis in the wild. Bagon appear to be highly opportunistic predators,  and typically feed on any creature visibly weak enough to be subdued and have been recorded scavenging carrion. Shelgon appear to share similar feeding habits as Bagon,  though with a much heavier emphasis on scavenging over hunting due to its weighty shell. Salamence are active predators,  and have a diet limited only by the thickness of its potential prey's hide and the presence of any toxins. In myths,  it is alleged that Salamence cannibalize their fellow brethren,  though this behavior has yet to be reliably documented either in the wild or in captivity.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Bagon and its brethren have long been vilified in mythology and in media as vicious,  heartless killing machines. Although such a depiction is undoubtedly rife with hyperbole,  saying that members of this line are not to be trifled with would be a gross understatement.
<p></p>Although Bagon are undoubtedly the least aggressive of the members of its line,  they still pose several dangers to Trainers in captivity and in the wild. Although Bagon may look cute,  and like most Pokémon tend to shy away from creatures visibly larger than themselves,  a frightened or irritated Bagon in the wild or in captivity,  like any Pokémon that feels threatened,  will lash out at a perceived threat. Bagon are known to readily employ moves such as Bite against opponents,  which can result in numerous puncture wounds and if bitten with the fangs towards the hinge of a Bagon's jaws,  deep gashes requiring medical sutures. Bagon will also attack perceived foes by ramming them with their armored heads. In spite of their small stature,  Bagon headbutts are known to be powerful enough to break bones and to knock adult humans off of their feet. In addition,  Bagon,  especially those nearing the point of their evolution into Shelgon are known to use incendiary breath attacks,  which are more than capable of inflicting second or third-degree burns. Wild Bagon pose a unique danger to trainers through their tendency to engage in cliff-dives. Although their intent is typically not malicious,  with an average weight of 40 kilograms,  encounters with falling Bagon are typically fatal,  and in regions where Bagon are known to live,  trainers and hikers are urged to keep a healthy distance away from high cliff faces.
<p></p>Although their lethargic movements would suggest otherwise,  Shelgon also pose threats to imprudent trainers in captivity and in the wild. Wild Shelgon are typically malnourished,  due in no small part to their hefty and cumbersome shell,  which makes them more readily irritable than their younger counterparts. Like Bagon,  Shelgon also utilize headbutts as a major attack strategy,  and are more than capable of sudden lunges towards a target. While the effects of a Bagon's headbutt can be quite serious,  Shelgon headbutts tend to be far more damaging. With an average individual topping the scales at over 110 kilograms,  a Shelgon's headbutt is more than capable of breaking numerous bones at once and causing massive internal bleeding,  often requiring the prompt hospitalization of the unlucky trainer at the receiving end. Shelgon also employ both biting and clawing attacks against their foes. If bitten or clawed by a Shelgon,  deep gashes are almost a given,  and it is not unheard of for some injuries to be serious enough to cause heavy blood loss. Shelgon also more readily employ incendiary breath attacks than their younger brethren and are capable of inflicting second and third degree burns over larger areas of the body with their attacks. Although wild encounters with Shelgon are almost unheard of,  the recent introduction of a stable population of Shelgon into Southwestern Johto has prompted officials in that region to begin putting up notices encouraging trainers to keep their distance from wild Shelgon.
<p></p>Although they have been known to exhibit immense loyalty to their trainers,  Salamence are by far the most dangerous members of the Bagon line. As creatures,  Salamence are effectively living weapons,  with sharp claws on each limb,  a mouthful of razor-like teeth,  and breath attacks with a destructive potential that are second only to those a handful of other Pokémon. Unlike both of its younger brethren,  Salamence is not only capable of killing and devouring an unwary trainer without great effort,  but has been recorded as doing so on occasion. In spite of Salamence's reputation as a man-eater,  it appears that the vast majority of fatal encounters between humans and Salamence stem from the latter's notorious temperament rather than any true hunger. Salamence by and large are notoriously ill-tempered,  and typically suffer intruders on their territory of any sort and perceived threats to themselves or to any offspring or companions exceedingly poorly. Researchers are presently at a loss to account for the degree of aggression exhibited by Salamence,  though observations of captive individuals suggest a connection between individual Salamence's experiences as a Shelgon and its temperament after evolution. An enraged Salamence is often also a public safety hazard,  as incensed Salamence have been noted to enter mindless rampages that end only after the individual is too physically exhausted to continue. Due to their incredible strength and their often vicious temperament,  it is not unheard of for a captive Salamence's opponent in a battle to be seriously injured or killed. For this reason,  a number of minor leagues and tournaments have opted to ban the creatures entirely from their matches and a handful of larger leagues have received petitions from concerned trainers and public safety officials to follow suit,  though they presently remain legal in the Indigo,  Hoenn,  Sinnoh,  and Isshu Leagues.
<p></p>In recent years,  members of the Bagon line have begun to be portrayed in a more sympathetic light in media,  including a recent animated adaptation of the first book of a fairly successful series revolving around a teenage trainer and his Salamence. Naturally,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedStapler' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedStapler'>demand for these creatures has risen</a> among trainers,  including fairly young trainers,  which has been a cause of concern among many health and public safety officials,  who are attempting to gauge whether the increased interest in these creatures will taper off quickly or be a longer-term phenomena similar to the interest in members of the Sandshrew line. Law enforcement officials have noted a significant uptick in trafficking of Pokémon in the Bagon line,  as well as an uptick in the number of injuries and deaths stemming from bungled attempts to poach these rare creatures.
<p></p><h2> Courting</h2>
<p></p>All stages of the Bagon line are capable of breeding,  Bagon being the most commonly observed specimen by nature of its relative abundance in the wild in comparison to its elder brethren. The known mating season for wild members of the Bagon line appears to be early spring,  though wild individuals living in cave systems and captive individuals are known to mate at times long after the conventional mating season. Both male Bagon and Shelgon appear to spar with each other to woo mates by what appears to be ritualized headbutting,  not wholly unlike behavior exhibited by such Pokémon as Stantler. Although these matches typically end with little harm to their participants,  it is not unheard of for the matches to devolve into brutal and protracted brawls. Courtship among Salamence is still poorly understood,  due to the species' immense rarity in the wild and great dangers inherent to approaching wild Salamence. According to myth,  Salamence courtship involves males attempting to woo a potential mate through aerial battles often causing great harm to those involved. However,  given the less than flattering tone many myths take towards Salamence,  it is unknown how much,  or for that matter,  if any portion of these accounts are reliable. In all observed cases,  the victor of these sparring matches will mate with the female in her den and will remain with her until she lays her eggs before leaving. Despite this,  accounts of mating pairs lasting for extended periods of time after the female lays her eggs are not unheard of,  and are an anomaly of interest to researchers. Members of the Bagon line have been recorded courting and mating with species within their egg group outside of their immediate line such as members of the Charmander line,  though occurrences outside of captivity are very uncommon.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>After laying her eggs,  the female will guard her eggs until they hatch and continue to protect her young as long as they remain nearby for 8-12 months. Unlike more mammilian Pokémon,  members of the Bagon line tend to afford their young more freedom to roam around,  and for reasons unknown,  unlike many Pokémon that raise their young in a similar fashion,  appear to have a relatively low mortality rate among their offspring. After the 8-12 month period of protection expires,  the mother will drive off the last stragglers from her den to fend for themselves. On their own,  Bagon typically organize themselves into small groups of 2-5 individuals for protection and for food,  which remain fairly stable until a period shortly before their evolution into Shelgon,  where the groups begin to dissolve. In both the Shelgon stage and if attained,  the Salamence stage,  individuals lead fairly solitary existences,  and only allow potential mates or close acquaintances or from their days as Bagon to enter their territory without being attacked.
<p></p>EDIT: In case if you haven't already noticed,  my grammar is fairly appalling as well...

</div>Now for Chinchou
<p></p><span style='font-size:144%'>Chinchou Line</span>
<p></p><h2>Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<ul ><li> Chinchou [#170]
</li><li> Lanturn [#171]
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Notable Biology</h2>
Chinchou are small,  blue,  and round fish-like Pokemon that are found at depths down to a mile underneath the ocean. Their most famous feature are two antennae with yellow bulbs that are positively and negatively charged due to a special species of bacteria. It uses them to attract and kill prey,  defend itself from predators,  and to communicate. A common use of Chinchou by fishermen is to use them to attract fish towards their nets,  with a fish being given as a reward. Navies will use Chinchou as a replacement for signal lights on boats,  as they are capable of surviving long periods outside the water,  even though they are a deep-water species.
<p></p>Lanturn are fish-like Pokemon somewhat reminiscent of a dolphin. The two antennae on Chinchou have now become a single antennae with two bulbs. Lanturn use their bulbs in the same way as Chinchou,  but they are capable or generating a much higher electric current. Their bulbs are also much brighter,  and are capable of lighting up the ocean's surface from three miles down. This has led to Lantern earning the nickname of "The Deep-Sea Star",  as their lights can give the sea the appearance of a starlit night.
<p></p>Their communication is done primarily through flashes using their antennae. Every Chinchou and Lantern has a unique flash pattern used to identify themselves,  and there are about 1, 000 recognized patterns known to science. These flashes are so bright that trainers are known to use Lanern and Chinchou to attract wild Pokemon for capture by blinding them so that the Trainer can more easily catch them.
<p></p>Another interesting attribute is their ability to convert electrical charges into energy,  a unique side effect of their partial Electric typing. It works by the antennae catching electricity and the bacteria  metabolizing it into energy,  which is then absorbed by the Pokemon.
<p></p><h2>Habitat</h2>
Both Chinchou and Lanturn are found near the ocean floor off the coasts of Johto,  Hoenn,  and Sinnoh,  with Lanturn living even deeper. They prefer temperate to tropical waters,  explaining their rarity in the Sinnoh region.
<p></p><h2>Diet</h2>
Both members of the Chinchou line hunt and kill prey by using electric pulses from their antennae. Chinchou prefer small fish,  whereas Lanturn will eat Pokemon such as Tentacool and Krabby after stunning them with an electric shock.
<p></p><h2>Hazards</h2>
Both Chinchou and Lanturn prefer to avoid confrontation,  and will swim away if they feel threatened. If a trainer persists,  however,  they will retaliate with powerful electric shocks amplified by the salt water. Brain damage and/or death have been known to occur if the shock is powerful enough. For this reason,  it is advised for trainers to have a Pokemon with resistance to both Water and Electric moves on hand.
<p></p><h2>Courting and Childrearing</h2>
Chinchou and Lanturn males attract mates by using flash patterns unique to each individual. Females will mate with the Pokemon with the brightest antennae,  and will attach their eggs to seaweed in shallower water near drop-off points. After hatching,  the young Chinchou head instinctively towards the darker depths,  looking for a school to join.
<p></p><h2>Social Structure</h2>
Chinchou live either alone or in small schools of up to 20 indivuduals,  who keep together through flashes. After they evolve into Lanturn,  they split up into groups of 3-5 individuals,  though loners are not uncommon.

<p></p><span style='font-size:144%'>Dratini Line</span>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<ul ><li> Dratini [147]
</li><li> Dragonair [148]
</li><li> Dragonite [149]
</li></ul><p></p><em>TODO: physical descriptions</em>
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>Dratini is a curious species of ophidian Pokémon with a life-cycle similar to some newts. The base stage is a thick,  six-foot long blue serpent with a white underbelly; it grows continuously throughout its life,  moulting repeatedly until it reaches sexual maturity. Dratini possesses a prominent white nose and,  upon cursory examination,  appears to lack a mouth; the orifice is in fact hidden beneath folds of skin that close seamlessly,  hence the illusion that there is no mouth. In addition,  this morph is notable for a silver nub between its large red eyes,  and for its finlike ears that propel it through water. It possesses a bizarre dual-respiratory system that allows it to remain underwater indefinitely and still breathe on the surface,  but it must periodically return to the water to moisturize its skin or it will die of dehydration.
<p></p>Dragonair is very similar to the previous stage,  but is more than twice as long and far more slender in appearance. The fins have now become a small pair of feathered wings which,  despite all appearances to the contrary,  allow Dragonair to fly. In addition,  the nub on Dratinis forehead has grown into a short horn,  and a sapphire pearl has formed beneath Dragonairs chin. Two similar orbs are found at the tip of its tail. The exact purpose of these orbs is unknown,  but the prevailing theory amongst the scientific community is that they are utilized to help Dragonair control the weather. Recent studies have shown that this power is a highly specialized form of psychokinesis,  allowing Dragonair to subtly alter air currents to disperse storms or conjure tornados,  and this "aerokinesis" may in fact be the source of the Pokemon's seemingly inexplicable flight.
<p></p>Dragonite is radically different from either of its previous morphs,  being a large,  bipedal reptile resembling a childs depiction of a dragon. It is orange with tan-coloured belly scales and teal wing membranes. The horn it possessed as Dragonair has migrated to the top of its head,  and it now has an overt mouth. Dragonite is shorter but far stouter than Dragonair,  and despite its bulk,  Dragonite is incredibly agile while airborne,  due primarily to internal helium sacs and a hollow skeletal structure; how it produces or acquires this helium is a mistery. A common misconception holds that particularly healthy specimens can circumnavigate the globe in as little as sixteen hours; while this is almost certainly an exaggeration,  Dragonite are amazingly swift flyers with impressive endurance,  being slightly behind Garchomp in maximum airspeed and equal to Farfetch'd in power flying. Two antennae jut from either side of the horn; these can detect minute shifts in temperature and air pressure,  allowing Dragonite to anticipate the distribution of storms and air currents and react accordingly. Finally,  the aerokinetic powers which it possessed as Dragonair have atrophied,  in that it is no longer able to create or disperse storms.
<p></p>These combined characteristics had biologists baffled as to how they should classify Dratini; furthermore,  while it initially appeared to be a water Pokemon,  a cursory study of its type resistances revealed that possessed a weakness to extreme cold and a resistance to electricity,  which no water Pokemon could have without being some mutant with three or more types. As a result,  biologists were forced to create a fifteenth type in order to classify it,  making Dratini the first discovered dragon-type Pokemon.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Dratini is an elusive Pokémon in the wild,  owing largely to their low birthrate,  incredible longevity and near-extermination by hunters in recent prehistory; as such,  Dratini was long believed to be a mythical creature akin to the Bunyip or the plesiosaurus until a small colony of the creatures was discovered near what would become the Safari Zone. Today,  Dratini is found only in warm ponds and riverbeds,  where they spend their time sifting through the silt in search of food. The creature has been successfully introduced to Johto and the warmer parts of Sinnoh,  but cannot survive in Orre,  as the arid nation lacks enough standing water to support a Dratini colony.
<p></p>Upon maturing into Dragonair,  they become too large for their birth-ponds to support them and so set out to sea. Crossing the land poses no difficulty as this serpentine Pokémon can fly despite lacking any wings (other than its ears,  but they should not be able to provide the lift and thrust necessary to propel a thirteen-foot long snake through the air). Dragonair that take up residence in the ocean often lair in coral reefs while sleeping,  coming up to the surface only to hunt and breed.
<p></p>Dragonite are so rare in the wild and move so quickly that determining what environment they prefer is nigh-impossible; the prevailing theory is that they roost on an uncharted island somewhere south of the Sevii Islands and the Orange Archipelago.
Alternatively,  as they retain their dual-respiratory system it is possible that Dragonite slumbers on the abyssal plain,  where the immense pressure would kill almost any other life form.
<h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Although they lack visible mouths,  Dratini are,  without question,  apex predators. They swim slowly through the water until they locate an edible creature,  and then send out a weak electrical shock to paralyze it and prevent escape. Once they have actually reached their victim,  they ensnare it within their coils and squeeze the life out of it before swallowing them whole. Krabby,  Goldeen and Magikarp are their most common prey.
<p></p>As Dragonair,  the species becomes much faster and therefore much more active,  and its ability to fly means that it is no longer limited to aquatic prey. Dragonair uses its speed and aerokinetic powers to stagger and confuse prey while bludgeoning them to death with its powerful tail,  before crushing and ingesting the victim in much the same manner as Dratini. They typically target smaller animals than themselves,  like Seaking,  Slowpoke and Gorebyss,  but will occasionally go after larger targets such as Slowbro or Croconaw. Thankfully,  they tend avoid humans unless provoked.
<p></p>Dragonite are almost entirely piscivorous,  swooping out of the sky to snatch up fish they saw from ten miles away. They have also been known to simply open their mouths and ingest entire flocks of Wingull on the fly.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
Dratini and its evolutions are ordinarily docile and leery of humans,  and as such they usually present no risk. That said,  they have the power to control the weather; provoking them is not a good idea. Even Dratini has limited aerokinetic powers which,  while not strong enough to pick up a human being,  are certainly capable of snatching up sticks and stones in a small cyclone and hurling them with enough force to break every bone in the human body. Also,  trainers must take care to instil restraint in their Dratini,  as a happy Dratini is still a large constrictor,  and they have been known to severely injure or kill their owners with an overenthusiastic display of affection.
<p></p><h2> Courting</h2>
The species is known to breed during the Dragonair stage,  congregating every forty years over the pools where they were born and depositing a single egg for the male to fertilize. both parents brood the egg,  moving it around to ensure that it maintains a warm temperature and to protect it from predators. Once the egg hatches the parents depart,  going their separate ways as they return to the sea.
<p></p>Dragonite have never been observed breeding in the wild or in captivity,  although it is theorized that it is possible for them to do so. alternatively,  The Dragonite phase may be the equivalent of a middle-agedor elderly human,  and thus no longer capable of reproduction.

</div>^^ Pretty good,  though a few niggles on my part... Although Helium would definitely keep a Dragonite aloft,  is there any particular way that it would synthesize or capture it? Noble gases <em>do</em> tend to be extremely rare in nature... Also,  I'm pretty sure that Dratini and Dragonair (especially the latter) have <a class='urllink' href='http://serebii.net/anime/pictures/johto/255ps6.shtml'>mouths<img src="http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;" /></a> (Pic on the left of the row just above the bottom)... Also looking forward to hearing your take on the biology behind those buggers' beam attacks and the hazards associated with Dragonair and Dragonite.

</div>Thank you for pointing that out. I never saw that episode,  and going by the official artwork and the sprites you really wouldn't think they have mouthes. More stuff is forthcoming.

<p></p><h2>Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<ul ><li> Caterpie [#010]
</li><li> Metapod [#011]
</li><li> Butterfree [#012]
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Notable Biology</h2>
Native to the forests of Kanto,  Johto,  and Sinnoh,  Caterpie are small Pokemon that are highly reminiscent of caterpillars,  primarily that of a swallowtail butterfly. They have feet like suction cups that allow them to climb any surface. Caterpie generally spend their lives eating vegetation on trees,  away from predators such as Rattata,  Pidgey. and Spearow. Caterpie eat their weight in leaves every day,  and can strip a forest bare if left unchecked.
<p></p>If their head feeler is touched or if they are attacked,  the Caterpie will release a foul smell to discourage their predator. While this can work on mammalian Pokemon such as Rattata,  avian Pokemon such as Pidgey and Spearow have little to no sense of smell. In that case,  the Caterpie will attempt to wrap up their adversary with String Shot,  binding them to the ground with silk and gving them time to crawl away. Caterpie silk is biodegradable and will weaken in an hour,  but it is also strong and a predator can have a much easier time with a bound Pokemon.
<p></p>When a Caterpie has eaten enough,  it will wrap itself in silk and evolve into Metapod. Metapod are green Pokemon that resemble a crysalis. They spend most of the time suspended from trees using their silk,  and require nothing to eat,  as they survive off the energy they gained as a Caterpie. Their shells are as hard as iron,  and they become even harder when they use Harden,  leading to Metapod becoming a phallic symbol due to its shape. As a result,  a popular sexual Internet meme is "harder than a Metapod".
<p></p>Once a Metapod has spent enough time growing,  it will evolve into its final form of Butterfree. Butterfree live off pollen,  honey,  and nectar,  and can fly in any weather due to rain-resistant scales. These scales also have different properties,  allowing Butterfree to use Stun Spore,  Sleep Powder,  and Poisonpowder. Sleep Powder in particular is used to knock out the guards of a Combee or Beedrill hive so that Butterfree can steal their honey.
<p></p>Butterfree are docile,  unlike their predatory Beutifly cousins,  but will defend themselves,  with the spores used depending on the severity of the threat. Higher level Butterfree can also learn Psychic moves such as Confusion and Psybeam.
<p></p><h2>Habitat</h2>
All members of the Caterpie line are found inside forests.
<p></p><h2>Diet</h2>
Caterpie live off of leaves,  whereas Metapod don't eat anything. Butterfree live off of pollen,  nectar,  and honey.
<p></p><h2>Hazards</h2>
Caterpie and Metapod pose no threat to humans,  although the occassional Metapod hanging up in a tree may fall on a trainers head. Butterfree prefer to fly away than fight,  but if they are threatened significantly enough,  they will defend themselves by attempting to put you to sleep with Sleep Powder. If that doesn't work and the trainer persists,  the Butterfree will use either Stun Spore or Poisonpowder to put an adversary down for good.
<p></p><h2>Courting and Childrearing</h2>
During the mating season,  Butterfree will form huge flocks over water. Male Butterfree will then start looking for females to mate with. If the female is receptive,  they will do an aerial mating dance before mating. Afterwards,  the Butterfree will then fly over to a new forest to lay their eggs,  often under leaves. Butterfree do not practice parental care,  and the young Caterpie are left on their own.
<p></p><h2>Social Structure</h2>
Caterpie can be found in groups,  but possess no true grouping instincts. Metapod are found by themselves,  and Butterfree are either solitary or found in flocks if food is particularly plentiful.
