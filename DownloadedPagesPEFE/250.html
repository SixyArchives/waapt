<p></p><div class="wmglead" ><strong>Larvitar Line</strong></div>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Larvitar [246]
</li><li> Pupitar [247]
</li><li> Tyranitar [248]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>The creatures of the Larvitar line are reptilian creatures that share few physical features in common beyond the presence of structures that emit pressurized gases to varying extents,  the presence of rigid sections covered by fused scales on their bodies.
<p></p>Larvitar is a bipedal creature that averages 60 centimeters in height when fully grown,  with females generally trending larger than males. In most early Pokedex entries,  Larvitar are recorded as having an average weight of 70 kilograms. Although the average Larvitar will indeed average such a weight shortly prior to its evolution,  for the bulk of its existence,  a Larvitar will weigh a fraction of this stated figure,  with newly hatched Larvitar rarely exceeding 15 kilograms in weight. Some of Larvitar's most immediately obvious physical features include a prominent,  fin-like head crest,  a pair of arms lacking defined digits,  two single-toed feet,  a red rhombal patch of fused scales similar in structure to the keratinous shells of creatures such as Squirtle on the abdomen,  and the presence of four ports for pressurized gases ringing a Larvitar's body that are typically closed by "caps" of black soft tissue. Larvitar also possesses a short,  banded tail with a large flower-shaped structure with seven petals that opens up at its base (researchers are still uncertain as to whether this structure serves any practical role for Larvitar,  though some observations suggest this "flower" is used as a traction aid while excavating soil). Barring its patch of fused scales,  the tissue covering its ports,  and a small pair of patches of black scales just under its eyes,  the bulk of a Larvitar's hide is covered in a layer of unfused olive scales.
<p></p>The second form of this line,  Pupitar,  is a spiky chrysalis-like Pokemon that averages 120 centimeters in length and typically weighs just over 150 kilograms. Unlike Larvitar,  the bulk of the ports on a Pupitar's body are not covered by layers of soft tissue,  but rather thick extensions of its larger hide,  with two very visible exceptions above its eyes retaining caps of soft black tissue. Barring the aforementioned caps and two small regions around its eyes,  Pupitar are covered in a durable layer of bluish semi-fused scales,  which despite their superficial similarity to similar structures on Larvitar and Tyranitar,  appear to capable of being readily flaked off and molted. The primary features of Pupitar's body include a virtually imperceptible mouth,  and a "mask" composed of a set of three backwards-raking spikes on either side of its eyes,  a cluster of three backward-swept head spikes,  and two nublike spikes along its lower body to aid with stability,  which foreshadow the structures that will be present on the body of Pupitar's final form.
<p></p>Tyranitar,  the final stage of the Larvitar line,  is a truly massive and imposing creature that typically stands a full two meters in height and weighs over 200 kilograms. Some of the most immediately apparent facets of a Tyranitar's appearance include prominent its spikes,  including a set of head and neck spikes with structures carried over from the "mask" spikes possessed as a Pupitar,  which are coupled with three pairs of spikes above a Tyranitar's shoulders. Other notable structures include the emergence of three prominent clawed digits on Tyranitar's feet and hands,  the emergence of two rhombal regions of fused scales similar in coloration to those possessed as Pupitar,  one occupying a position analogous to that of Larvitar's patch of fused scales along with a second along its lower back,  a long tail with a banded tip and a five-petaled flower near its end,  and the emergence of gas ports closed by layers of black tissue on a Tyranitar's chest,  thighs,  and upper back. As with Larvitar,  the bulk of a Tyranitar's hide is covered in unfused olive,  which in this stage,  take on a segmented appearance on some regions of the body,  not wholly unlike that of an exoskeleton,  most notably in regions along the limbs.
<p></p>It should be noted that the appearance and physical stature of creatures from this line are often influenced by such a creature's host environment. The most immediately obvious influence of local environment upon these creatures' appearance appears to be the relationship between soil composition and hide coloration,  with coloration trending lighter or darker depending upon the relative abundance or scarcity of a small number of different minerals. Environmental factors such as the amount of food present appear to also influence the size of these creatures,  which can lead to dramatic differences in these creatures' later stages. One of the most dramatic examples of this influence of environmental conditions can be seen in a side-by-side comparison of Johto and Quest Island Tyranitar,  the prototypical individual from the former averages over 220 centimeters in height,  and the latter averages less than 170.
<p></p>As with other Pokemon,  creatures from the Larvitar line appear to have a mutant phenotype that manifests itself in exceedingly rare circumstances,  which appear to affect regions of the body that are not covered in black scales or soft tissue. As Larvitar,  carriers of this mutant phenotype display magenta rhombal scales and light green scales covering the rest of their body,  as Pupitar such individuals are covered in violet fused scales,  and as Tyranitar,  possess a tan hide and violet rhombal scales.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>One of the defining features of creatures from the Larvitar line is the presence of structures that dispel pressurized gases from these creatures' bodies. These structures are particularly pronounced in the Pupitar stage,  where these structures provide the primary means of movement for these creatures,  via the use of releases of pressurized gases for a form of crude rocket-like propulsion. In all stages,  these structures appear to accumulate a great deal of particulate matter,  which enables creatures from this line to generate billowing clouds of sand and dust to help disorient and wear down opponents in battle.
<p></p>Creatures from this line are noted for having exceptionally tough hides composed of fused and unfused scales,  depending upon the region of the body,  which grow increasingly durable and rigid with evolution due to the accumulation of minerals from feeding,  with properties not wholly unlike the exoskeleton of some invertebrate Pokemon. These hides,  especially in the Pupitar and Tyranitar stages are immensely resilient,  capable of shrugging off most blunt force attacks and rendering these creatures largely immune to the pain from all but a handful of especially potent techniques. The hides of these creatures do carry some notable soft points,  which are markedly more responsive to sensation and susceptible to irritants than most other regions,  some of the most prominent regions including the black regions of tissue that close these creatures' gas ports and the soles of a Tyranitar's feet. While quick to regenerate in the Larvitar and especially the Pupitar stages,  the hides of these creatures are notoriously slow to regenerate in the final form,  Tyranitar,  which can cause regions of hide that have been damaged in the wild to remain susceptible to irritants for months after the initial wound.
<p></p>Members of this line also appear to have a set of organs consisting of a sac that accumulates flammable chemicals generated from the process of consuming food and a series of vestigial electrogenic cells scattered in different regions of the body,  though most notably at the back of the throat. These structures typically remain dormant until the late Pupitar or Tyranitar stage,  where they help to facilitate incendiary breath techniques such as Hyper Beam,  and with training,  can be utilized to perform a number of other battle techniques.
<p></p>Two distinct submorphs of creatures from the Larvitar line are known to exist,  which are differentiated primarily by traits that individuals exhibit while in the Larvitar and Tyranitar stages. In the most common submorph,  individuals as Larvitar exhibit a pronounced fight or flight response when afflicted with one of a certain range of physical ailments,  which causes attacks to become markedly more powerful. As Tyranitar,  these individuals appear to instinctively generate clouds of sand and dust when aggressive,  which has helped to contribute to the popular imagery of these creatures as walking wastelands. Individuals hailing from the second,  and vastly rarer submorph have a dramatically less pronounced fight or flight response to the same ailments that their more common counterparts do,  but appear to be less susceptible to irritants in their eyes,  which enables them to move around more easily in sandstorms. As Tyranitar,  these individuals are noted to lack the instinctive dispersion of sand and dust when aggressive,  but appear to trend more physically imposing than their more common counterparts,  and are often physically larger with more prominent teeth and claws,  which are known to have an often demoralizing effect on opponents.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Although rare,  stable populations of Larvitar are known to exist in a range of mountainous and cave environments,  ranging from massive inland mountain ranges,  smaller coastal ranges,  and in a few cases,  on isolated islands. Particularly large populations of Larvitar are known to exist in the general vicinity surrounding the western end of Kanto Route 28,  on Quest Island,  especially in the Sevault Canyon area,  and in the ranges along the western foot of Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh,  overlapping with local Routes 206 and 207. Although individual Pupitar and Tyranitar are known to dwell in the general vicinity of regions supporting stable populations of Larvitar,  Pupitar and Tyranitar are virtually unknown. One of the most prominent exceptions is Unova Route 15,  which houses one of the largest populations of Pupitar and Tyranitar presently known to exist.
<p></p>The interactions between members of the Larvitar line and their surrounding environment appears to be heavily influenced by the relative availability of food and territory. In regions where food and territory are plentiful and geologic activity is minimal,  some of the most dramatic manifestations of Larvitar and its evolutions as a disruptive force can be observed,  making these creatures at once a blessing and a curse to cartographers. Particularly (in)famous phenomena that have been recorded amongst such populations include the wholesale destruction of forest cover,  the diversion of the course of streams in order to expose riverbed sediment for consumption,  and in a few truly remarkable cases,  the literal erasure of mountains from their places. One of the most heavily documented instances of this phenomena involved a breeding pair of Tyranitar and their progeny removing a 1000 meter tall peak from existence over the course of 150 years through progressively chipping away at the mountain through their activities.
<p></p>The behavior of Larvitar and its evolutions in regions where food and/or territory is scarce,  whether by geography or by population density,  or where their surroundings are potentially geologically volatile,  appear to be markedly more subdued,  with ecologically disruptive activities associated with members of this line in other regions bearing evidence of being vastly more structured in nature. Perhaps the most extreme example of this can be seen on Quest Island,  where local Larvitar line members have been recorded periodically abandoning portions of settled territories to live elsewhere,  only returning after the landscape has returned to its equilibrium before these creatures' presence. Larvitar members from this population also appear to generally be more loath to trigger landslides or otherwise undermine the structural integrity of the peaks that they dwell around,  which is presumably due to the combined effects of Quest's isolation from potential replacement territories via the sea,  as well as the island's volcanic nature.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>All three stages of the Larvitar line are theoretically omnivorous with an increasingly heavy carnivorous slant with each progressive evolution,  in the wild,  members of the Larvitar line are better known for transitioning from a primarily lithovorous to a primarily carnivorous diet with evolution.
<p></p>Larvitar exhibit the most versatile diet among its brethren in captivity,  and have in some cases been recorded as being capable of metabolizing substances ranging from plant matter,  meat,  to less conventional materials such as clay and iron filings. In their native environment,  Larvitar possess a diet composed primarily of soil,  augmented by a wide variety of plant matter and the occasional opportunistic kill or scavenged carrion. Larvitar possess an astonishingly fast metabolism,  meals typically pass through a Larvitar's digestive system in under an hour,  with Larvitar in some regions having been recorded consuming dozen of times their body weight in food over the course of a day. The bulk of a Larvitar's meal passes through without being digested,  which when coupled with their most common source of sustenance,  leads to the creatures playing a role as major aerators of soil in their host regions,  not wholly unlike Onix and its evolution.
<p></p>Pupitar exhibit the most versatile diet among other members of its line in the wild,  with wild Pupitar deriving the bulk of their sustenance from opportunistic hunting,  but also from plant matter and occasional lithovorous behavior. Pupitar's hunting habits evidence influence by its still-present lithovorous tendencies,  with the most frequently documented prey for Pupitar in most regions consisting of Rock and Steel-Type Pokemon. Unlike Larvitar,  Pupitar's metabolism is both markedly slower and efficient at digesting food,  with Pupitar in regions subject to seasonal food scarcity exhibiting activities similar to hibernation.
<p></p>In both captivity and especially in the wild,  Tyranitar's diet as an apex predator trends heavily carnivorous. Among wild Tyranitar,  with the demands for a constant influx of mineral nutrients to preserve the durability of its hide are typically satisfied by the consumption of Rock and Steel-Type quarry,  with direct lithovorous behavior effectively non-existent amongst wild Tyranitar outside of severely malnourished individuals. Consumption of plant matter is similarly rare in wild settings without the absence of normal prey.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Larvitar and its brethren have long been subjected to an exaggerated and often extremely vitriolic depiction in human media and folklore,  which has only recently begun to improve thanks in part to greater understanding of these creatures' roles in long-term patterns of geological activity in their host mountain regions. Despite this,  saying that undue harassment of creatures from this line is inadvisable would be an understatement at best.
<p></p>Although Larvitar are generally shy and by far trend the least aggressive of all of the forms of this line,  they are by no means defenseless creatures,  and as with any other Pokemon,  are not unknown to lash out at perceived aggressors. One of Larvitar's primary modes of attack is to utilize biting techniques,  which in spite of its seemingly underdeveloped jaws,  are more than capable of leaving deep puncture wounds. Larvitar also utilize techniques that incorporate the lobbing of heavy objects,  typically stones,  at aggressors,  which are capable of causing lacerations,  bruises,  and in more extreme cases,  hairline fractures in limbs. Larvitar also utilize tackling attacks,  which although generally not particularly powerful can lead to fairly serious injuries,  especially from attacks of this nature launched by physically heftier individuals such as Larvitar nearing evolution.
<p></p>Larvitar's initial evolution,  Pupitar,  shares most of the same methods of attack as its younger counterpart,  albeit with much greater potency,  a greater gravitation towards tackling attacks,  and a markedly less pronounced preference to flee from the face of perceived threats. Unlike most Pokemon that undergo a similar pupal stage,  Pupitar is relatively mobile,  traveling in short rapid bursts in straight lines from the release of pressurized gases as a propellant. Pupitar are known to build up truly immense amounts of momentum during these bursts,  with records of particularly forceful Pupitar impacts triggering landslides and leaving impact craters in cliff faces. With an average weight in excess of 150 kilograms,  encounters with flying Pupitar are typically extremely grave,  if not outright fatal. Pupitar are known to exhibit limited abilities over paranormal phenomena,  one of the most common manifestations of this ability being the use of the technique Dark Pulse,  particularly strong Pupitar are also known to be capable of employing incendiary beam attacks,  which are capable of readily inflicting second and third degree burns over large portions of the body.
<p></p>Although known to exhibit great fealty to their trainers and other allies,  Tyranitar are truly in a class of their own in comparison to their younger brethren and most other Pokemon in terms of raw destructive potential. With an immensely territorial and often belligerent nature,  sharp claws on each limb,  immensely powerful jaws lined with razor-sharp teeth,  and a strength known to be capable of altering the topography of mountainsides and reducing even the most formidable mountain into a molehill given a sufficient timeframe and focus,  it goes without saying that a large number of run-ins between humans and irate Tyranitar are lethal. Attempting to encounter Tyranitar,  especially without the protection of Pokemon of one's own,  is generally inadvisable,  as individuals generally have an extremely limited tolerance for creatures beyond potential mates,  offspring,  and close acquaintances on their territory. If an encounter is unavoidable,  it is almost always preferable to use Repels or techniques such as Stun Spore in order to buy time to retreat rather than to engage a wild Tyranitar in battle.
<p></p>A number of other hazards related to training or otherwise remaining in near proximity to individuals from the Larvitar line exist. It should be noted that while Larvitar and its evolutions are not recommended Pokemon for novice trainers by any stretch of the imagination,  that individuals from environments with more numerous natural predators or rivals are known to be difficult for even veteran trainers to accommodate. Individuals hailing from around Unova's Route 15 are known to be infamously demanding to train,  and often have significant problems learning to exercise restraint in battle,  and thanks to behaviors associated with female individuals with young,  are known to be especially difficult to control if attempting to organize breeding in captivity. As with other Pokemon,  the relative level of difficulty of training a member of the Larvitar line increases significantly with each progressive evolution,  with wild Tyranitar considered to be effectively impossible to train reliably in most circles. Regions that are known to house stable populations of creatures of these lines are often subject to frequent rockfalls and landslides,  making unwary travel an unwise proposition. Trainers traveling through regions that share populations of Larvitar and Aron line members within proximity of each other are strongly urged to avoid traveling with members of one line in areas known to host individuals from the other. In such environments,  creatures from these lines are almost always natural rivals,  which when coupled with the immensely territorial bent of both lines' final stages,  leads to an animosity with a virulence that rivals that of the aggressive tendencies documented between Seviper and Zangoose,  resulting in immensely destructive battles that often do not end until one of the two has been slain in combat. For Aggron trainers with enough of a death wish to attempt to engage a wild Tyranitar with their respective natural nemesis in such an environment (encounters with Tyranitar elsewhere being only marginally better),  it is often recommended to pray to any deities that one may venerate that it is not the Tyranitar that emerges triumphant.
<p></p><h2> Courting</h2>
<p></p>All stages of the Larvitar line are theoretically capable of mating,  though it should be noted that in wild contexts,  mating is documented only among Larvitar and Tyranitar,  with effective mating between Pupitar virtually impossible without the aid of artificial insemination. Among wild Larvitar,  courtship appears to be revolve around offerings of gifts of food,  typically berries or portions of meat,  coupled along with feats of strength to woo suitors. No consistent courtship patterns appear to have been documented among Tyranitar,  with most studies suggesting that wild Tyranitar engage in fundamentally opportunistic mating. Female Tyranitar appear to have eggs fertilized successfully roughly once for every three incidences of mating,  which yield clutches of 1-2 eggs,  with female Larvitar laying solitary eggs,  with a markedly lower incidence of successful fertilization. Mating pairs typically dissolve shortly after the act,  though exceptions to this rule have occasionally been documented,  one of the most remarkable of these was an incidence of a mating pair between two Larvitar surviving well beyond both individuals' eventual evolution into Tyranitar. As with other Pokemon,  Larvitar and its elder brethren are capable of mating with creatures from outside their immediate line,  though this practice is seldom recorded outside of captivity.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Once a female individual from this line has laid her eggs,  she will bury them deep underground,  typically far apart so that her young arent forced to compete with any siblings or other Larvitar for food,  and wait until they hatch,  watching over her offspring from a distance and only interceding if they are threatened. This vigilant,  but aloof relationship is maintained for the bulk of a newly-hatched Larvitar's existence,  ending only with the natural drift of offspring away from their home environment,  the death of the mother,  or failing both of those,  the evolution of the young into Pupitar. It should be noted that Tyranitar appear to exhibit a markedly more intimate relationship with their offspring,  and typically maintain a closer orbit to their charges than most Larvitar mothers do,  with maternal behaviors in the populations on Quest Island and most notably in the regions surrounding Unova Route 15 known to be especially strong.
<p></p>Because of their rarity and low birthrate,  Larvitar and its evolutions are primarily asocial creatures. As Larvitar,  individuals typically lack intimate interaction with others from their line barring with siblings and their mothers,  and typically only exhibit grouping behavior for the purposes of feeding. As Pupitar,  individuals begin to drift further apart from each other,  and begin to exhibit stronger territorial behaviors,  though it is not unknown to find a number of Pupitar sharing a common peak together. It is unusual,  but not unheard of,  to find multiple Tyranitar sharing a common mountain. In all but a handful of host environments,  if this phenomenon occurs,  the two will either court with or attempt to destroy each other depending on what genders the Tyranitar are,  which often results in the effective obliteration of the local topography. In spite of this territorial bent,  Tyranitar are known to allow certain Pokemon to reside within their territories unmolested,  as part of a symbiotic relationship either for the benefit of the individual or the long-term viability of his/her territory,  one of the most documented examples of these relationships is the bonds formed between Tyranitar and Pokemon such as Gligar that act as cleaning agents.
<p></p><h2> In Human Society</h2>
<p></p>Larvitar and its brethren have historically been demonized by most cultures that have come into contact with them as insolent,  vicious brutes that sow destruction without the slightest consideration of the effects on other creatures. Larvitar were often widely reviled for their disruptive habits of feeding upon topsoil,  Pupitar for being a bane to travelers and livestock along mountainous passes. Compared to these two,  the amount of sheer vitriol directed towards Tyranitar in folklore appears to truly be in a class of its own,  and are often depicted as insolent,  vicious,  and mindless brutes that sow destruction without the slightest forethought.
<p></p>Despite this generally unflattering depiction,  it should be noted that these creatures have long had a history of being trained by humans. Most of these applications were primarily military-oriented,  with these creatures often being raised by handlers from a young age,  if not from eggs to eventually see deployment as weapons against fortifications and would-be underminers. Not unlike many other Pokemon with a history of extensive military service,  Tyranitar in the service of opposing miitaries were often widely reviled by contemporaries of the conflicts that saw their use. These creatures also saw more nuanced applications within the traditions of some mountainous villages,  with the very creatures so utterly despised in most folklore and typically used as weapons of war serving as deeply respected agents helping to make mountains more suitable for the cultivation of crops and to clear new passes for purposes of transportation.
<p></p>In modern media,  the long shadow of historical perception continues to color most depictions of Larvitar and its evolutions. One of the most prominent of these is a decades-old movie franchise based off of the mythical exploits of a truly massive Tyranitar,  which sees its main subject presented as,  at best,  a destructive savior. Members of this line,  especially Tyranitar,  see employment as antagonistic figures in a truly dizzying array of media. A number of more positive portrayals of creatures from this line have arisen in more recent years,  many of which are parodies of Larvitar and its brethren's traditional portrayal within media,  including as a recurring background show-within-a-show character in a much vaunted animated television show following the world as perceived by a group of infants.

</div>Glad to see the revision,  in particular the improvements to the Habitat section,  which has grown from a one-liner to,  essentially,  a section <em>about</em> Habitat,  micro and macro.
<p></p>Since I don't remember what Abilities do Larvitars get except for insta-sandstorm,  I'm not gonna comment on that section at the moment,  although I noticed again it is treated as two submorphs,  which suggests both abilities are physiological. I'd love to see TCG or PMD material thrown in there for a future revision,  considering TCG Tars get Darkness Drive and Tyranitar is in IQ Group C,  which includes No-Charger and Aggressor.
<p></p>Also,  Tracer,  sorry for not having completed the binomes in time,  couldn't exactly come up with anything beyond the common (family?) term suggestions that I already sent you. Unfortunately pretty much no one else seem to be doing them ATM.
<p></p>Which reminds me: I'm retconning Nidoran binomes,  at least for the basic morphs,  for Nidoran v.5.

</div>A question I have is on our fossil Pokémon policy. Now,  so far its been a given that <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeConstruction' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeConstruction'>a problem with the regeneration process</a> is that Fossil Pokémon are uncomfortable with modern foods,  while being super-susceptible to our modern pathogens due to not building immunities. But a problem there is that you are compounding Time With place. Viruses are some of the most supersensitive constructs around only being abler to infect a specific type of cell within a certain range of organisms (i.e. Rabies only works on Neurons in mammals). So for these beings,  who have long ago fallen off the genealogical radar would more likely be <em>immune</em> to our modern viruses that are built to prey off our Pokémon. (Except for those that would exist in that era) Another problem I have is that grass-type Pokémon are described as recent; when a very large subcategory of them (I've dubbed then Arbosaurs) Are essentially ancient reptiles with Plant Parts; implying that Grass-types go far back. (I would also note that Pokémon typing is a construct of the League that really has no steady biological basis; its pretty much in-story gameplay). If we look at Grass-Types we see that the earliest Pokémon would be    the Oddish line placing it in the Aptid era of the early cretaceous; firmly before the temporal range of the Cranidos which is dated in canon to 100 mya.
<p></p>Id also like to start a reexamination on various organizations and Civilizations.
<p></p>	The Battle Frontier
	The Pokémon Leagues
	The Pokémon G-Men
	The Relic Castle People
	The Kingdom of Black and White
	The Pokémon association
	The Egg Groups
	Evolution Stones (I note we seem to have a back-and-forth over whether they are naturally occurring minerals needed for evolution or if they are just substitutions for what can be achieved through other means (extreme heat; Moonlight etc.)
<p></p>The nature of Egg groups is something Ive been working on with my Litwick article and I could do a write up of at least one egg group (and maybe the entire concept) ; as for the Relic People Ive already done an article that Ill have to dig up to be posted. Ill be on chat now.

</div>My quick thoughts on the ninjedited subjects:
<p></p><ul ><li> On Viruses: it works both ways. An organism that hasn't hit many found paths of evolution during the last eras would be susceptible to infection vectors and effects for which normal evolution has prepared other creatures. A good point on that it wouldn't effect them that strongly,  though it'd still mean most fossil mons would become easy carriers for modern viruses. It is a nice point that merits extra discussion so that we can sync the articles (I think except for Tirtouga we have them all already).
</li></ul><p></p>The key here is that,  the same way evolution (in the long term sense) adds needed resistances,  it removes the unneeded ones,  so it could even be the case that the inverse of what we have hold on the articles is true &#8212; the tissues and excretions of fossil mons are dangerous for <em>our</em> present-time mons.
<p></p><ul ><li> On Grass Types: Chikorita,  Tropius and Turtwig,  <em>in the least</em>,  are based off pretty ancient creatures,  yes,  but you didn't actually pose a question there.  <img src="http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/emoticon_surprised.png" height="16" width="16" alt="surprised" title="surprised" />
</li></ul><p></p>As for the Organizations and stuff (an area on which we're sorely lacking):
<p></p><ul ><li> Battle Frontier: at least one canon seems to suggest they work like the PMCs of the Pokémon World,  adding Pokémon wealth and firepower to private interests instead of to the open work and distribution the Pokémon League does in comparison (evil RBY E4 notwhitstanding). The other canons don't go into much historical depth for them,  although the fact that they can have Legendaries and that they dictate their own jurisdiction when dealing with them (anime Brandon and Regigigas) does bring in some ethical elements into question.
<p></p></li><li> Evolution Stones: ...they are both? At least,  if I can read the sync between articles right. Compare trade evolution. The only one I can think is problematic here is actually the Moss/whatever evolution path for Leafeon,  for reasons I have already exposed in the chatroom (distribution and stability,  mostly).
<p></p></li><li> Egg Groups: an interesting matter. So long as a treatment on the subject considers some borderline cases (Nidoran comes to mind,  obviously) and that it allows for viviparous reproduction (which I think we have already integrated in several articles and IMHO makes too much sense to pass over),  I'm golden with any potential approach. Considering its depth as a game mechanic interface,  we are allowed quite some spread there.

</div>I'm writing a Taxonomy of the Pokémon verse (given their origin it's be more like a Epigenetic map but w/e) In REALLY short it works by associating Groups to Clades i.e. Fields to Mammals Monsters to Reptiles Dragons to Dromaeosaurs etc. Mixed groups are results of "missing links" and otherwise intermediary formes and the symbiotic nature that lead to the Arbosaurs is an example of how the process works both ways. The Amorphous group Pokémon all spontaneously generate from inanimate substances (Trash,  Wax,  Sludge,  gas,  Magma,  Plasma,  Water,  and Gold etc.) Therefore,  i think a common origin would be a series of Protista based microorganisms that often form speciated macropylp colonies that retain genetic compatibility (thus the shared craigovrous habits of the Yamask and Litwick lines.)  The purest form of this group would most likely be the Solosis.
<p></p>I could make a chart...

</div>The problem with that is how to explain Pokemon like the Shellos and Tynamo lines which are also part of the Amorphous group without being made from inanimate objects and mediums. Also,  how do explain reptilian Pokemon such as the Snivy and Sandile lines which are Field group affiliated Pokemon?

</div>I hardly see Pokémon taxonomy following a tree homomorphic (or epimorphic? I don't remember) to the one we know at RL. If we were by the very basis of what the canons show,  it's be like,  what,  a three or four level tree,  but with an incredible (and ever-expanding) width. So I don't see all of this being an issue,  except once we get to discuss Egg Groups and the actual naming part of taxonomy (ie.: should all Dragon types have similar binomes?).

<p></p>Also,  reminding/suggesting some policy because we're reaching the point where it is needed: If you detect a substantial unsupervised and potentially conflicting or simply <em>offensive</em> edit,  as it has happened already,  we undo the changes (as it has been indicated at the main page already) and send a PM to the troper telling them to come to the thread for discussion. If the changes would merit making it into the article,  we can check them and vouch for them from here,  whereas trolls simply won't get to pass crap into the articles.

</div>Well,  I finally got around to finishing Litwick.
<p></p><h1> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]/[Juniper Catalog #]</h1>
<ul ><li>Litwick [607]/[113]
</li><li>Lampent [608]/[114]
</li><li>Chandelure [609]/[115]
</li></ul><p></p>Litwick is a short,  half-melted candle with yellow eyes. Despite no presence of a wick,  its flame burns with a flickering purple light and consumes energy,  emotions,  and other sensations from living things near it. Although Litwick are capable of forming mouths,  they are primarily used for vocalization. Like other ghost Pokemon,  Litwick is capable of manipulating its body,  and can be found in many different shapes.
<p></p>Lampent bears an image similar to that of an old-fashioned lamp. Lampents glassy face shields its inner fire from being extinguished,  and a small vent in the cover over its head provides it with air. The ghostly arms extending from Lampents body allow it to hold itself on objects,  leading some communities to employ tame Lampent to act as streetlights.
<p></p>Chandelure is a medium size chandelier-shaped Pokemon with an appearance similar to Lampent. After evolving,  Chandelure retains its globe-shaped glass head,  but the covering above it is gone,  leaving its flame to rise freely into the air. From the bottom of the globe extend two metallic bands,  which curve upwards to about the level of Chandelures eyes. From each of these grows two candle holders,  from which Chandelure releases flames for offense and protection.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>Litwicks body appears to be made almost entirely from wax,  existing as a massive non-lipid germinal epithelium,  with fatty wax cells being stored to power its metabolism. X-ray equipment has been able to take images of Litwicks body,  which seem to show that it does have some form of internal organs made out of other waxy substances. Despite being seen to come into contact with solid surfaces,  Litwick have occasionally been sighted floating through walls,  which suggests that like other Ghost-type Pokemon,  Litwick has some control over its molecules,  so it is at least partially formed of umbrate. The Litwick line is notable in being one of the few known carbon-based life forms to have their cellular structure be primarily ester-sterol rather than the lipid based structure of most beings; this is hypothesized to be the result of the evolution of a proto-epilobia like creature (the Common Ancestor of the Indeterminate Pokemon) within a pool of high wax content,  akin to the modern development of the Grimer. One of the most notable aspects of the line is that they are psychiphagic; while the Litwick may ingest the occasional raw minerals to build up its silicate shell,  the primary chemical reaction that drives its biology must be fueled by the life energy provided by most life forms. Litwick break down local minerals to form a buildup of ore within their bodies in a long internal wick with which they digest the ambient electromagnetism of various creatures. The product of this metabolism,  a constant purple-blue flame,  is one of the hallmarks of the line and its glow has been adapted by years of evolution as a lure and a weapon,  and also seems to contain the Litwicks brain.  As it matures,  Litwick will develop protective glass shells and metallic arms for self-defense,  with its original waxy body hidden inside,  causing it to evolve into a Lampent. When significant amounts of certain type of ore,  found only in Dusk Stones,  have developed within its central spire,  a Lampent will process them into a larger external shell made of organic glass and an organic metal system of capillaries,  allowing better manipulation of the internal flame.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Litwick frequently live in places with large amounts of Psychic Pokemon,  as these provide large volumes of food. Due to worldwide hunting efforts due to their negative image the only known stable population of Litwick exist within Celestial Tower in the Unova region. Other Litwick,  Lampent,  and Chandelure can be occasionally found in the wild,  but these lead solitary lives and live in environments inhospitable to most life-forms in order to more easily kill and feed on their prey.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Although it has a mouth,  Litwick does not actually eat physical food. The line is exclusively psychiphagous in the early stages of its life,  using the neurological energy of other life forms to feed its eternal combustion,  a necessary feature for its unique structure. Although they can absorb energy from living creatures,  Litwick are more suited to feeding on the recently dead,  as they cannot fend off an attack. Litwick also use their lights to lure people and wild Pokemon to death in order to absorb the energy of the dying souls.
<p></p>Like Litwick,  Lampent absorbs energy from the living. Thus they become scavengers; unlike the juvenile form,  Lampent follow those who are about to die,  having adapted to absorb larger quantities of energy from them more easily than from healthy individuals. Because of this,  Lampent often hang onto buildings pretending to be lamps in order to more easily find prey.
<p></p>Because Chandelure are rarely sighted in the wild,  there have been few opportunities to examine them. Based on the behavior of captive specimens,  Chandelure appear to have a diet similar to Litwick and Lampent. However,  most Chandelure are capable of draining far more energy than either of its pre-evolutions,  and can easily feed on fully healthy hosts. If any living thing becomes immersed a Chandelures central flame,  almost all of its life force will be transferred to the predator,  leaving a barely animate and intelligence lacking body behind. This has lead to many stories of creatures called 'zombies' attacking towns and attempting to eat the inhabitants. Because Chandelure require immense quantities of energy to sustain their abilities,  they often also drain energy from nonliving parts of their environments in the form of heat. This is all that makes it feasible for them to expend large amounts of energy for attack and defense,  so Chandelure in colder environments eventually become unable to use more powerful abilities.
<p></p><h2> Behavior</h2>
<p></p>Litwick is known for its habit of leading lost people into dangerous and often deadly situations by imitating human lighting in areas that are not safe for humans. It is commonly theorized that this behavior is due to Litwick not being mature enough to drain enough energy for survival from a living host,  and thus attempts to cause deaths for it to feed upon. This may also have led to legends of Litwick leading dead souls to the afterlife,  although it is more likely that Litwick actually absorbs the dead souls instead.
<p></p>Upon evolving into Lampent,  it appears to gain the ability to sense when death is about to occur. It will often follow a person whose death it senses is near,  siphoning off small volumes of energy from the target until their death. If a Lampent is following you for no apparent reason,  dont panic,  but remain alert and seek medical assistance. This trickery has led to widespread mistrust of this Pokemon and many superstitions linking it and misfortune. However,  in some cultures Trainers who own a Lampent are considered lucky,  as they can save trainers that they like from accidents; but it is a bad idea for trainers to mistreat Lampent as they may intentionally lead those they hate into harm.
<p></p>Of the few Chandelure observed in the wild,  almost all live in rocky,  dry areas. Little is known about their patterns of behavior,  as it is impossible for researchers to get close without the Chandelure becoming aware of their presence and attacking. The only fact known to be completely true is that wild Chandelure are very territorial and will attempt to feed on anything that enters its area.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>As the line is inherently psychiphagous,  be sure to prevent your Litwick,  Lampent,  or Chandelure from feeding on other members of your party. As overfeeding is the number one causes of death around Litwick,  it is suggested that Trainers purchase a radio-based Artificial Soul Substitute machine instead; foraging for natural silicates is also encouraged. Once it has developed into a Lampent,  your Pokémon should feed on energy from wild Pokemon,  as it has developed enough to feed efficiently off the living,  and will otherwise feed on you and your party. On evolving into Chandelure,  it will absorb energy from any living thing it encounters,  so make sure that it encounters wild Pokemon daily and does not feed too much on any one living thing to do it harm.
<p></p>In the wild,  the members of the Litwick line are inherently dangerous. Litwick frequently live in dangerous areas and will attempt to lure you into harms way so that they may feed off of you. Lampent and Chandelure regard anything nearby as potential prey,  so it is wise to stay as far away as possible. All three members of the line also attack anything they see as at all dangerous with their flames,  so always carry multiple Burn Heals on you while in their territory. While Litwick can only cause mild injuries,  Lampent can cause large burns and Chandelure is capable of serious injuries and may also cause wildfires.
<p></p>Members of the Litwick line also have one of several dangerous physical defensive capabilities. Some of the morphs convert internal energy to superheat their outside,  and anything that comes into contact with them may become burnt quite badly. Others have adapted themselves to absorb large amounts of heat that could otherwise hurt them. These members of the line are able to draw in heat energy from their exterior,  which they then use to augment the power and heat of their own flame-based attacks. Examinations of Litwick's DNA has also shown a dormant gene that could theoretically allow them to exert some form of hypnosis over their prey as they drain its life force,  preventing the victim from running away,  but this has never been observed in nature.
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>All members are capable of reproduction,  although this is more common with the juvenile stage,  due to their larger amounts of fat and energy. Baby Litwick are produced when male Litwick release a spermatozoon glob of molten wax,  which melts and mixes with some of the wax on the female,  forming into a Litwick embryo. This embryo remains attacked to the female until it reaches full size,  then disconnects and begins to live on its own. This method of reproduction generally occurs only where Litwick are swarming,  as swarms tend to appear in areas with high amounts of residual life energy,  such as graveyards,  where infants have a higher chance of survival.
<p></p>Lampent do not usually reproduce,  as they channel their energy towards growing and finding a Dusk Stone to evolve. On the rare occasions when Lampent do reproduce,  they do so in a manner similar to Litwick,  with the male and female mixing their flames and wax to produce the new Litwick.
<p></p>Chandelure reproduce very infrequently,  but when this occurs it is in a similar fashion to Lampent.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Litwick tend to live in large groups in their preferred habitats of graveyards or dangerous locales. These swarms seem to act at least partially as collective mindss,  as the Litwick are apparently capable of exchanging information telepathically,  and large groups frequently all act identically for brief periods. These groups ocasionally include a few Lampent,  which seem to function as seperate individuals while remaining connected to the groups hive mind. These Lampent are currently thought to lead their swarms,  and may be also capable of in some way influencing the hive mind. As Chandelure are very rare in the wild,  it is unknown whether they ever join these groups or how they function in them.
<p></p>When not part of these groups,  the members of the Litwick line are solitary. On occasion two or three Litwick may band together to lure or weaken their prey more effectively,  but their evolutions have never been sighted working together,  likely because they are strong enough to feed on their own. As the Pokemon of the Litwick line will absorb energy from whatever comes near it,  there are few predators capable of safely eating them,  so there is little risk for individuals living alone. Because of this,  mating rarely occurs outside of large swarms.

Since Litwick with Shadow Tag can't be obtained right now,  does it make any sense to mention them?

</div>Derp,  and thanks Smiggins,  I apreciate that comment as well. Pergaps mention that all the energy it absorbs daily gives it incredible energy attacks,  and that the Shadow Tag ability is hypothesized to exist based on analsys of its genetic code,  but that no examples in the wild have been discovered yet.
