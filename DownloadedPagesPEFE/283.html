(The forums do tend to be the first choice for removal whenever we have financial troubles.) Personally,  I don't really want to move,  but if that's what we have to do for our continued survival,  that's what we have to do.

In terms of housekeeping we'd have had to change it eventually anyway.
<p></p>I wouldn't revert it back for the moment.  I assume once we get access to the games (or somebody here understands Japanese; either way) we can expand upon that detail a bit.

</div>I think so,  via way of Caitlin.  She's had to spend a couple years getting older and able to control her psychic abilities to become a trainer from her days watching things in the Battle Castle in Pt/HGSS.

</div>My apologies for the double post,  but now its time for some inversed onis.
<p></p><h1> Throh and Sawk</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalogue #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Throh [#538]
</li><li> Sawk [#539]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Notable Bio</h2>
<p></p>Throh and Sawk are two fairly closely related species of Pokémon found within Unova and its surrounding regions. Throh is a red,  humanoid primate about 1.3 meters in height and about 55.5 kilograms in weight with a stocky build,  three fingers on each hand,  skin with a texture not unlike that of a rock,  and a Y-shaped crest over their eyebrows and nose. They are most often seen wearing a gi and a black belt. Sawk are much the same,  except that they stand taller at about 1.4 meters in height,  are lighter at 51 kilograms,  are blue in color,  and are far lankier in build than their cousins. They also have a Z-shaped crest over their nose and left eye.
<p></p>Throh,  the stockier and calmer of the two,  is known as the Judo Pokémon due to its habit of throwing any opponent that happens to be bigger than it is. Much like a judo practitioner,  Throh relies less on its own strength than using the strength of their own opponents against it. Sawk,  the lankier and more aggressive of the two,  is known as the Karate Pokemon due to its graceful fighting movements. Unlike Throh,  Sawk tend to focus more on brute strength when battling.
<p></p>Both species are famous for the belts that they wear,  which serve as an inverse to those worn by members of the <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Machop' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Machop'>Machop Line.</a> Unlike the gis,  which are made by <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Sewaddle' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Sewaddle'>Sewaddle</a> and their evolutions,  wild Throh and Sawk make the belts themselves using vines. When tightened,  both species will gain a psychological high,  allowing them to hit much harder. As a Throh or Sawk gets stronger,  he will change his belt for a different one,  much like a human martial artist.  Much like <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Cubone' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Cubone'>Cubone</a> wielding Thick Clubs,  particularly esteemed members of their communities will wear belts of an especially unique make,  often known as Black Belts among trainers. These Sawk and Throh appear to have increased martial arts apititude. Among this elite class,  the most esteemed of their groups will wear belts made of a special sort of vine known as an Expert Belt among trainers. Throh and Sawk who have worn these belts are noted as being able to hit opponents with super-effective techniques with increased power,  regardless of typing. In fact,  Throh and Sawk found without a belt will become depressed and despondent until they can find a substitute,  which can be as simple as a rope to something like ripped electrical wires. This can prove fatal to the Pokémon if those wires happened to be live beforehand.
<p></p>There appears to be two known subtypes of Throh and Sawk. Those with the first subtype share a heightened fight or flight response upon being burned,  paralyzed,  or poisoned. [[Trainer's Note: Some trainers will take advantage of this by giving their Throh or Sawk Orbs that will purposely burn or poison them.]] Throh of the first subtype happen to be immune to moves that would cause a loss in concentration due to an increased level of focus,  whereas Sawk of that subtype have such a physical defense that it is normally impossible to fell them with a single blow. Throh and Sawk of the second subtype trend somewhat bulkier and appear to have an increased strategic battling aptitude,  allowing them to circumvent a wide range of natural defenses,  including those employed by Pokemon capable of floating above the ground. Rarely,  Throh and Sawk can be born with orange and purple coloration respectively. These Pokémon tend to be highly prized by collectors.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Throh and Sawk prefer rough terrain of any kind in order to train,  with a particular preference towards mountainous areas with other species of Fighting type Pokémon such as <a class='createlink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Timburr' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Timburr'>Timburr</a> for the sake of training against. Within Unova,  members of these two species can be reliably found in the outer portion of Pinwheel Forest,  and Unova Routes 10,  15,  and 18. Recently,  they have also taken residence within Unovas Victory Road. Attempts have been made to find Throh and Sawk within Kanto and Johto (see In Human Culture),  but at the time of this article they have proven fruitless.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Both species are omnivorous with herbivorous tendencies,  though Sawk tends to be the more likely of the two to attempt eating meat. When it comes to plants,  they prefer eating high-energy foods rich in sugar such as Berries. When hunting for prey,  Throh will either throw rocks in an attempt to crush their preys spine,  or theyll attempt to grab their prey and throw it off the nearest high place. In the case of Sawk,  they tend to attempt to snap their preys neck using either chops or a well aimed kick. However,  it is noted that except in cases of extreme famine they will never go after a member of the Human-Like Egg Group (See Courting and Childrearing).
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Though both Throh and Sawk are noted as having great loyalty for their trainers,  like most Pokémon they do have their dangers. Despite their diminutive stature,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse'>both species are very strong for their size and will defend themselves if threatened.</a> <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueOni' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueOni'>While Throh tend to be of a calmer temperament than Sawk, </a> and prefer tossing their enemies away to outright confrontation,  if that doesnt work they will attempt constriction using their arms. Other techniques used involve allowing their opponent to strike them in order to get them close enough to attack with bursts of orange Aura,  adrenaline boosted strikes when in low health,  leers to weaken resolve,  using the force of gravity to slam their opponents into the ground,  and full body tackles capable of causing paralysis upon connecting. The most dangerous technique Throh can use,  however,  uses Aura in order to increase their strength,  which they then release with a single blow. However,  using this technique many times over a short period will temporarily severely weaken the user,  so it is normally only used as a last resort.
<p></p>Furthermore Throh live in groups of five,  and they are capable of spreading their arms wide in order to protect themselves and their comrades from wide ranging moves,  and it is in group combat that Throh truly excel,  using their combined strength to bring down even the largest of opponents. Due to their large amounts of stamina,  it is inadvisable to attempt to outlast the Pokémon if you lack any Psychic or Flying types,  and anyone meeting a group of hostile Throh is better off using Repels to ward them off.
<p></p>Unlike Throh,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOni' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOni'>Sawk are far more aggressive, </a> and tend to be fairly temperamental in character,  often attacking those who interrupt their training in their natural habitat should they not leave immediately. Unlike the more defensive Throh (although they share a number of the same techniques for waiting out opponents),  Sawk attack their enemies with chops and kicks capable of causing blows ranging from hairline fractures to major breakage. One chopping technique they have is capable of <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickBreak' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickBreak'>easily demolishing stacks of bricks, </a> and when charged with Aura is even capable of breaking through psychic barriers used to blunt the blows of physical and energy based attacks. Sawk are also willing to close the distance between themselves and their opponents and attack with a flurry of punches and kicks,  though this Close Combat can leave them open to attack. Much like Throh,  without the use of suitable Pokémon the best chance of getting out with major damage is through the use of Repels. Luckily,  unlike Throh Sawk are rarely seen in groups,  so being attacked by a mob is unlikely.
<p></p>While both species are formidable opponents alone,  together they make even more fearsome opponents due to their styles covering each others weaknesses,  with Throh tanking attacks to distract while Sawk deals blows from behind. Sawk can also use its superior speed to block techniques that are too fast for Throh while the latter wails on its opponent.
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>Due to the fact that Sawk and Throh are <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace'>100% male, </a> a mystery that continues to vex researchers to this day,  they are among the few Pokémon species that will regularly breed with other species outside of captivity. Both are fairly opportunistic breeding-wise,  and will mate at any chance they get. During the gestation period,  the Throh or Sawk will stay by their partner,  swiftly dealing with any possible threat. After a young Throh or Sawk is born,  both parents will raise the child together. In the case of the Pinwheel Forest population,  the children can get mixed with the crèches of Sewaddle as their parents search for food.
<p></p>Once they come of age,  their fathers will challenge them to a fight. Should the young Sawk or Throh weather the onslaught,  they will have earned the right to craft their own belt. In the absence of the father,  any closely related Throh or Sawk can perform the ritual. Afterwards,  they will either find others in order to form groups,  like Throh,  or strike out on their own in the case of Sawk. The breeding pair normally separates shortly afterwards,  though in captivity and some rare cases in the wild these bonds can last for life. Like most known species with one gender,  Throh and Sawk can only produce the mothers species in captivity without the use of Ditto,  due to an inability to enact the hormonal changes necessary to override the influence of the mothers genes.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Throh normally travel in groups of five,  much like a human judo team. These groups are normally for life,  only having members separate upon finding a mate,  and even then they normally will return once they consider their sons to be ready.  Sawk,  on the other hand,  spend their lives mainly alone,  only meeting with other Pokémon in order to spar or mate. Pinwheel Sawk do appear to be somewhat more sociable than members of their species from other places,  due to their close relation with the Sewaddle.
<p></p>Once every few years,  Sawk and Throh from all over will travel into the mountains in order to compete in what appear to be tournaments in order to discover the strongest among them.
<p></p><h2> In Human Society</h2>
<p></p>It is believed in some circles that Throh and Sawk may have exhibited a wider range in the past,  due to mythological figures in the artwork of the part of the world containing Kanto,  Johto,  Hoenn,  and Sinnoh closely resembling members of both species. Humans may have developed the earliest forms of karate and judo through observing and copying the movements of these Pokémon,  similarly to the creation of many other forms of martial arts. Throh and Sawk are also commonly used in dojos throughout the Unova region as training aides,  similar to the use of <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Machop' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Machop'>Machop</a>,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Tyrogue' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Tyrogue'>Tyrogue</a>,  and Makuhita Line members elsewhere in the world.
<p></p>One of the most well known depictions of both species in popular culture are as roommates in <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet'>a long running children's series.</a>

<p></p>Also,  I don't know if there's any indication of it in the games/anime,  but maybe there could be a social thing where once every year (or more) groups of Throh and/or Sawk come together and have tournament-esque get-togethers where they fight to find the strongest group/individual among them.

I just can't see the Torchic and Tepig lines fulfilling the role of the chicken and pig as a staple food. There both fire types and that should mean that they have a strong resistance to heat and therefore to getting cooked. In    my head I see cooking a Torchic or Tepig taking a similar amount of heat to what it take to cremate a similar sized non fire type Pokemon such as Taillow  and Bidoof if not more.

<p></p>Your point is valid for their hides... I mean,  a living fire-type should be able to shrug off most temps well... I guess the question is that if that fire-type is dead,  skinned,  and prepared in order to be turned into filets,  are those filets of flesh really going to be as fire-resistant as the living,  intact specimen?

</div>... they don't do descriptions for Berries I don't think.
<p></p>Studies of <a class='urllink' href='http://www.pikminwiki.com/Fiery_Blowhog'>an unrelated species with a pyro sac<img src="http://static.mediatropes.info/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;" /></a> indicate that creatures with them are only immune to dangerous sources of heat; cooking them should work the same as any other animal.
<p></p>On that note,  is there an application process for this? I'm from WAAPT and this looks interesting,  and I think I may have the writing skills to join the team.

</div>Time for my very first PEFE article!
<p></p><h1> Numel Line</h1>
<h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Numel [#322]
</li><li> Camerupt [#323]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>A typical Numel is a quadruped that bears a striking similarity to a dromedary camel. It is rather girthy,  being about as wide as it is long. Its four legs are extremely short,  the feet also strangely lack toes of any sort. It has two oblong spheres for ears,  and they stick out of the top of its head. Theres also three large hairs that stick to the top of its head,  and they are used to keep the head safe from falling rocks. The majority of it is yellow,  but it has a paler yellow on its underbelly and snout. There is a brown ring around its eyes that serve an unknown purpose. The top of the hump is green and as such looks like a hill. Females have a slightly larger hump than males do. The tip of the hump has a small hole that the Numel uses to cool off its body and especially its pyro sac due to the need to conserve water in the high-heat areas it lives in. Numel have underdeveloped brains; many lack adequate testosterone and endorphin-producing nerves,  and most of the ones that dont have been shown to have a large lack of attention to detail. Very rarely,  Numel have been found that have a strange way of moving; this is not due to fatigue but is a natural brain function.
<p></p>Once they mature,  the typical Numel becomes a typical Camerupt. Typical Camerupt are also quadrupeds; however they are a bright red-orange. They have evolved a second hump to become a Bactrian camel. These humps are also used to cool Camerupt; however,  they are used in a much different way. Camerupt have developed a special coolant that they use to cool their pyro sac and themselves as well. This coolant absorbs heat from Camerupt and gets vented through the sacs in a way that looks like a volcano expelling lava because the coolant is red and the humps look like volcanoes. Again,  females have slightly larger humps. Camerupts ears have drooped into a sideways position,  and the three hairs now stick up on its head. There is a zigzagging line connecting its eyes and below it on the snout the hairs turn gray. It has grown gray hooves and on each side there are three homogenous blue rings. These rings are also extractors of Camerupts coolant,  and it creates a notable effect of keeping Camerupt warm in the cool desert night. Oddly,  the coolant,  well,  cools on Camerupts fur and hardens in a large amount of cases; it is unknown if it is purposeful but it serves as a pseudo-exoskeleton of sorts,  weakening blows that are more dangerous to Camerupt. A rare amount of Camerupt dont have working extractors; this seems to cause them to get violently enraged when hit with strong attacks.
In extremely rare cases,  alternately-colored Numel and Camerupt have been spotted. The Numel are more pink with blue humps and brown eye rings,  and the Camerupt are a blue-gray with pink humps and snouts and yellow rings. Both are highly prized by collectors.
<h2> Habitat</h2>
Both Numel and Camerupt have been found near or in active volcanos. Camerupt are a very rare sight in Mt. Chimney,  but they are found with their young in Stark Mountain in Sinnoh. None have been found near Mt. Battle so far.
<h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>They dine on rocks in their environment due to the inability for plants to grow. Camerupt have this job easier due to being able to use a fusion  of the pyro sac and heated coolant to melt the rocks.
<h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Numel possess little to no threat due to their dull wit; they only act in self-defense. If you do manage to entice a Numel to attack,  they will spew flames at you,  but due to their need to cool,  they dont spew flames for long. At this point,  they will probably forget what they were doing and return to a passive state.
<p></p>Camerupt,  on the other hand,  are easily aggravated,  especially so if you encounter the rare submorph without side vents. With their coolant,  they can spew flames for very large amounts of time,  and if theyre strong enough,  they can use a very rapid combination of using and cooling their pyro sac and erupt it all out of their humps. They can also attack using their considerable girth to ram into things,  although fire is their preferred method.
<h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>Numel reproduce in a simple way,  breeding with the first mate they find. They retreat into a volcanic crevice to raise the young,  and spew flames at anything that gets close to it.
<p></p>Camerupt continue to oppose Numel in behavior,  and they compete for a mate by seeing who can shoot fire out of their humps the highest.  They also hide in a small,  safe cavern to raise their young and attack anything that gets near the entrance.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Numel generally live solitary lives,  being too simple to care. They respect each others space and dont really mind sharing.
<p></p>Camerupt,  again,  are not that way,  claiming a certain area of the volcano or caverns and attacking intruder Camerupt. They wont attack any Numel because they are clueless and unaware of the boundaries.

<p></p><em>In modern days,  Heatmor hunts Durant with tactics honed by years of evolution. The predator will wander around the base of a mountainside,  sniffing for traces of pheromones with its sensitive nose. Discriminating against older trails,  Heatmor will try to find a recently made unignited pheromone path left behind by a foraging party. Many times,  these trails are burrows located a meter or so below the surface,  so Heatmor will use its strong claws to gouge a large opening in the dirt above the tunnel. After it has found a decent spot,  the Pokemon will wait beside the trail,  remaining motionless to avoid tripping off any nearby Durants geo-location with vibrations.</em>

</div>Here's my Tympole article. Love these guys so let me know if you think iv'e gone overboard on a section.
<p></p><h2>Morphs [Oak Catalogue #]</h2>
<p></p>Tympole [535] - Pipa tympus
<p></p>Palpitoad [536] - Pipa vibris
<p></p>Seismitoad [537] - Pipa seismis
<p></p><h2>Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Tympole line are a trio of Anuran Water-type Pokémon that seem to be related to the Poliwag line native to the Kanto and Johto regions.
<p></p>Tympole the base form is a tadpole around 30-65cm in height and weighing between 3.5 and 6kg though members that are either larger or smaller exist. Tympole has a small ball like body covered in black skin with a large blue bump on either side which are actually Tympoles air-sac like cheeks and a large blue tail at the back. Tympoles face is cream coloured and possesses two large black eyes,  a mouth and eyebrows that resemble musical crotchets or quarter notes though no visible nose. Unlike some other tadpole Pokémon Tympole lacks any limbs. Tympole possess small gills that due to their black colour are difficult to see with the naked eye also unlike most tadpoles Tympole possess rudimentary lungs that allow them to breathe for short periods of time out of the water.
<p></p>During evolution Palpitoad has grown to between 75 and 95cm in height and between 16 and 19kg in weight. Palpitoad has also gained a pair of small three toed feet and Ground-type characteristics during evolution. Palpitoads body is largely blue in colouration with a cream stomach,  chest and the centre of its face. There is a thin black band between cream area and the blue of the rest of its body. Palpitoad possesses an air-sac like bump on either side of its head as well as on its forehead there is also a smaller bump on either side of its body about half way down its body. The tail that was present as a Tympole is still present however it is much smaller. The scleras of Palpitoads eyes have changed from the black they were as a Tympole to a whitish colour. Palpitoads gills a much smaller and it lungs much more developed allowing them to move around on land for a much longer period of time without needing to re-enter a body of water in order to breathe.
<p></p>During evolution Seismitoad has grown to between 1.4 and 1.7m in height and 50 to 70kg in weight. The most obvious change that has occurred during evolution into the fully mature toad is that Seismitoad now possesses two arms,  lacks a tail and has distinct legs and a distinct head. The area of Seismitoads body which was cream as a Palpitoad is now the same light blue as its air sacs. The scleras of Seismitoads eyes are now red with a small black pupil. Seismitoad now possesses an air-sac bump on either side of its forehead,  one on each shoulder and one on the back of each of its three fingered hands as well as possessing a small blue bump on each knee and four larger ones on its back. The gills that were present in the previous two stages are now completely gone with Seismitoad relying simply on its lungs to breathe.
<p></p><h2>Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>The most obvious feature of the Tympole line is the increasing number of air sacs they possess. These air-sacs can be vibrated causing a range of sounds and sound based attacks as well as a number of other effects. The sounds caused by these vibrations are generally too high pitched for humans to hear however Tympole will use these sound-waves and will use them to notify its friends of dangers. As a Palpitoad these vibrations can be used to cause waves and even earthquakes as well as for communication. As Seismitoad these vibrations can also be used to torment its opponents or to add extra power to its blows allowing it to use powerful Fighting-type moves such as Brick Break,  Rock Smash and Drain Punch though Drain Punch is the only one of these that does not require training with the aid of a TM to learn.
<p></p>As with any Water-type the members of this line possess an internal water sac allowing them to launch bubbles and high pressure jets of water at their opponents. The line also possess a poison-sac that allows them to fire an acidic liquid at their foes and with training other poisonous liquids and they also possess tubes that with training they can use to send liquid from the sac to their hands to inject it with their fingers or fire it as a wave or bomb like construct. Seismitoad is also able to shoot a paralysing liquid from their head bumps and can excrete a poisonous mucous-like substance from their skin as an act of self-defence. This line was also originally thought to be one of the few Water-type lines not to be able to learn a single Ice-type move though it has recently been discovered that with the right tutor they are capable of utilising a frigid punch and a frigid breath.
<p></p>Due the amphibious nature of this line of Pokémon members will cover themselves with a slimy substance when out of water to prevent themselves from drying out. All three members also have relatively thin skin with blood vessels very close to the surface allowing all three members to absorb oxygen through their skin as well as their lungs and in the case of Tympole and Palpitoad their gills.
<p></p>There are three distinct sub-groups of this line of Pokémon. The first sub-group possess what is known as the Swift Swim ability. Members with this ability possess larger muscles to move their tails as Tympole and Palpitoad and larger leg and arm muscles as a Seismitoad allowing them to move at higher speeds in aquatic environments and in heavy rain. The second sub-group as a Tympole and Palpitoad possess a unique chemical similar to that found in Full Heals in the slime they coat themselves in which when the slime is washed away by rain also removes any contagion or other substance whether internal or external that is causing a status problem for the Pokémon. As Seismitoad the poisonous substance members of this sub-group secrete from glands all over their body is far more potent,  being one of the most effective poisons known,  which allows them to poison opposing Pokémon when Seismitoad makes physical contact with it but not when the opponent strikes Seismitoad. It should be noted that Seismitoad is the only Pokémon capable of possessing this Poison Touch ability that is not a Poison-type and also where the sub-group possessing the ability is not rarer than normal.  The third and final sub-group is also the rarest and possess the Water Absorb ability. The members with this ability possess the ability to absorb water into the slime they coat themselves with and use this water to heal themselves by up to a quarter of their full health when they are struck by a Water-type move even when launched by an ally.
As with all Pokémon the Tympole line has members that possess a unique phenotype that alters their colouration. As a Tympole they possess goldish-yellow bumps and tail. As a Palpitoad the bumps are still yellow but the tail is the same greyish colour as those on normally coloured Palpitoad however their body is a cyan colour as opposed to the dark blue of normal members. As Seismitoad their body is a greenish cyan colour with orange bumps and chest.
<p></p><h2>Habitat</h2>
<p></p>All three forms can be most commonly found around lakes and other large bodies of still water. They can also be found in fields and grasslands that surround large bodies of water or which have a significant number of smaller bodies of water. Due to possessing legs and the ability to breathe above water Palpitoad and Seismitoad can be found at much greater distances from the body of water they call home. Tympole are most commonly found in and around Pinwheel Forest due to the large bodies of still water within the forest and the almost permanent puddles in the areas surrounding the forest. As well as the area around Pinwheel forest Palpitoad can also be found deep in Wellspring Cave and the areas around the Moor of Icirrus and Icirrus city indicating that due to their new ground typing the second and third stages of this line are also happy to live in swampy areas. Seismitoad are very rare in the wild due to living deep in the forests they call home but will occasionally be encountered in the same areas as Palpitoad as they will sometimes wander out in search of food,  to find a mate or to find another Seismitoad to fight.
It should also be noted that Palpitoad and Seismitoad are completely absent from the areas around the Moor of Icirrus during winter due to the cold causing the members that live in these areas to retreat underground to hibernate.
<p></p>There is also believed to be small numbers of this line in other regions living in similar habitats to their cousins in the Poliwag line however due to the limited numbers in these regions it is highly unlikely that a trainer will ever encounter a member of this line outside of the Unova region without the assistance of a Pokémon Professor or a Pokémon Ranger.
<p></p><h2>Diet</h2>
<p></p>All three members of this line are largely carnivorous though all will happily eat any berries or Pokémon food they are offered by their trainer.
<p></p>Tympole mostly feed off of aquatic insects and small fish though they will occasionally feed on flying or terrestrial insects that come close to the water edge and they are able to stun with their water or sound based attacks.
<p></p>Palpitoad also feeds on aquatic insects and any fish smaller than itself though it is now much more likely to feed off of flying and terrestrial insects due to being able to use its long sticky tongue to ease the catching process.
<p></p>Seismitoad will generally feed off of any animal smaller than itself including rats,  small birds,  fish and of course insects with one wild Seismitoad being reported as attempting to capture an insect as significantly larger than itself as a Yanmega.
<p></p>All three members of the line will use their vibration abilities to incredible effectiveness in hunting down prey often using it to stun the prey before finishing it off with their water and earth based moves. Palpitoad and Seismitoad will also often use their vibrations to cause small tremors in the earth causing burrowing animals to the surface where they will quickly finish off any they deem small enough to attempt eating. It should also be noted that due to their Ground-type characteristics Palpitoad and Seismitoad are two of the only Pokémon that can effectively prey on the members of the Joltik line.
<p></p><h2>Hazards</h2>
<p></p>All three members of the line are relatively docile and will only attack in order to defend themselves or their territory. The greatest danger the members of the Tympole line pose is their ability to create vibrations.
<p></p>All three members can create vibrations that can cause annoyance,  discomfort and sometimes pain in humans with the vibrations caused by Seismitoad being known to reach levels where they can cause internal damage to humans though it is uncommon for a Seismitoad to actively attempt this in normal circumstances. There are also risks posed by the earthquakes that Palpitoad and Seismitoad are able to trigger using their vibrations.
<p></p>The poisonous substance that Seismitoad secrete is capable of causing paralysis and in the weak,  young or elderly it is capable of killing. It should be noted that this substance is only dangerous when ingested and thus if contact is made with the substance washing ones hands before handling food or touching ones moth,  eyes or other orifices is usually enough to prevent being poisoned. Should any of the poison be ingested medical assistance should be sought immediately.
Despite their docile nature when travelling through areas known to be home to members of this line it is recommended that trainers be accompanied by a Grass-type Pokémon,  Electric-type Pokémon are not recommended due to the Ground-type characteristics of the latter two stages of this line.
<p></p><h2>Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Tympole line tend to live in large groups numbering up to two dozen or more members when in the Tympole stage with the large group size allowing them to protect each other from predators. These groups are sometimes led by a single Palpitoad by are usually independent of their later stages.
<p></p>Palpitoad and Seismitoad both live solitary lives only coming together in order to mate though as previously stated Palpitoad will sometimes lead a group of Tympole.
<p></p><h2>Courting</h2>
<p></p>Though all three morphs are capable of breeding only Seismitoad will do so in the wild. During the rainy season the males will attract a female by producing a sharp clicking sound. Unlike other frogs and toads this sound isnt made using a throat sac or similar construct but by snapping the hyoid bone in their throat. Once a mate has been found the male will mount the female in an amplexus,  or breeding embrace,  the pair will then flip through the water in arcs.
<p></p>During these arcs the female will release eggs from her cloaca which are then fertilised by the male and then embedded into the back of the female where they adhere to her sponge-like skin. After about ten days each egg is embedded in its own chamber. The eggs remain here until they are ready to hatch at which time the young Tympole emerge fully developed though significantly smaller than their normal size though they will quickly grow to this size within a week or two.
<p></p>After hatching the mother leaves the young Tympole to fend for themselves.
<p></p>Due to the extra safety involved members that breed in captivity will lay a single less developed young within an egg.
<p></p><h2>In Human Society</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Tympole line appear in numerous forms in media. A pair of Seismitoads star as the player characters in <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Battletoads' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Battletoads'>a 90s video game notorious for its difficulty,  one story saying the game has never been finished,  and its humorous fighting gameplay.</a> Another Seismitoad acts as a secondary character in a <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox'>series of games about a bounty hunting team lead by a male Ninetails and is known as one of the most hated characters in video games.</a> <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWindintheWillows' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWindintheWillows'>A Seismitoad was also a character in a well-loved story</a> and a Palpitoad is the pet of a secondary character in <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter'>a series of stories about a teenage wizard.</a>
<p></p>It was also popular in the past the either lick live Seismitoads or to ingest the poison they excrete from their skin in order to achieve a narcotic high. This practice is almost non-existent these days due to a combination of the toxicity of the poison and the practice becoming illegal,  though there are still small numbers of the population who partake in this hazardous and illegal practice.
