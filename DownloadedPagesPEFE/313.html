</div>Here's the first draft of the Litleo article
<p></p><h1>Litleo Line</h1>
<p></p><h2>Morphs [Oak Catalogue #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li>   Litleo [667]  Panthera ignis
<p></p></li><li>   Pyroar [668]  Panthera incendium
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Litleo line are a pair of quadruped,  feline dual Fire and Normal type Pokémon. Litleo stands at around 60cm tall and can weigh anywhere between 10 and 16kg though members that are either larger or smaller exist. Litleos body is covered in black fur with pale brown fur on its paws,  ears,  tip of its tail and its muzzle. Its head holds two large black eyes,  a reddish-orange nose and a red Mohawk-like tuft of hair between its ears.
<p></p>Upon evolution into Pyroar it grows to between 1.35 and 1.65m tall and can weigh between 75 and 100kg. Pyroar keeps the black fur of its previous form though the pale brown fur now covers its full legs,  face and underside. Its tail has grown in length and its eyes have turned blue in colour. Male Pyroar have a large red mane around its face with five yellow/gold streaks through it that make a vague Daimonji shape. Females have a long flowing red and yellow/gold swoop of hair that reaches past the base of their tail growing from their forehead.
<p></p>As with all Pokémon the Litleo line has members that exhibit a rare phenotype that alters their colouring. These members as Litleo have a greyish colouring with white fur in place of pale brown. Both Litleos nose and tuft of hair become more orange in colour as opposed to being closer to red in colour in normal Litleo. Upon evolution to Pyroar members with this phenotype have a golden colour to their fur which lightens to a yellowish colour on their paws and face while they have red eyes instead of the usual blue and their manes are slightly lighter in colour than normal.
<p></p><h2>Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>As dual Fire and Normal Pokémon the members of the Litleo line are t unique in possessing both the pyro-kinetic abilities of a Fire type Pokémon but also the unique adaptability of a Normal type Pokémon and are the only two Pokémon currently known to possess this specific combination of types. They are also the only two Pokémon currently known to be able to use the technique Noble Roar to intimidate their opponents and weakening their attacks.
<p></p>Both members possess both a fully developed pyro-sac allowing them to unleash powerful torrents of flame. The pyro-sac is partially connected via fire proof tubes to their saliva glands allowing them to deliver burning bites. At higher ages Pyroar and Litleo begin to develop trace amounts of umbrate in their teeth allowing them to deliver a devastating bite known as the Crunch attack. Finally both species have powerful and highly developed vocal chords which they can use to unleash deafening roars on their foes.
<p></p>Litleo and Pyroar both a small omni-sac which allows them to deliver a barrage of toxic sludge or a powerful and reckless electrical tackle if trained properly. They can also be trained deliver a powerful tackle from beneath the ground or deliver a minor shockwave through the earth. If properly trained the members of the Litleo line can use the umbrate in their teeth in conjunction with their omni-sac to unleash a pulse of umbrate on their foes.
<p></p>There are three distinct sub-groups of these Pokémon. The first subgroup of these Pokémon have a high honourable streak which causes a physiological response that leads to changes in their physical strength depending on the gender of their opponent. If their opponent is male it leads to greater physical strength while a female opponent leads to lower physical strength,  in the cases where the opponent has no gender physical strength remains at a base level. Scientists are still yet to fully understand how this gender based response works and are studying the Litleo line and other Pokémon with this Rivalry Ability
<p></p>The second sub-group possess what is known as the Unnerve Ability. These members possess larger teeth and claws as well as the ability to stand their hair on end in order to prevent their foe from ingesting any berry it may have in its possession.
<p></p>The third and rarest sub-group of the Litleo Line possess an extra modified adrenal gland that seems to work off of some psychological reward system. Whenever a member of this sub-group defeats an individual,  even an ally,  in battle it receives a dose of adrenalin increasing its physical strength. Scientists are still yet to fully understand this ability referred to by trainers as the Moxie Ability
<p></p><h2>Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Both forms make their home in fields and plains where they can use their superior eyesight to spot prey and threats to their young. They also occasionally make their homes in hilly of slightly mountainous terrain.
<p></p>Litleo is a fairly common Pokémon on Kalos Route 22 though its not known to be found anywhere else. Pyroar are rarely seen in the wild though a tourist attraction in Kiloude City has been known to have Pyroar within its boundaries.
<p></p><h2>Diet</h2>
<p></p>Litleo and Pyroar are both carnivorous in the wild with the females hunting down and killing almost anything they can find with there being reports of a group of female Pyroar taking down prey much larger then themselves.
<p></p>In captivity if offered both members will happily eat berries and Pokémon food but the majority of their diet should consist of raw meat.
<p></p><h2>Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Both members of the Litleo line are dangerous and much care needs to be taken around them even those that belong to a trainer. Both members of this line have incredibly sharp teeth and claws and Pyroar can easily rip apart a human. When approaching a trained Litleo or Pyroar it is important to only approach in the presence of the trainer so the Pokémon recognises you as a friend.
<p></p>In the wild NEVER approach a Pyroar alone,  only ever do so with other people present if absolutely necessary and while accompanied by a Rock,  Ground,  Fighting or Water type Pokémon,  preferably more than one. Litleo in the wild should only ever be approached in order to battle it as they will see anyone approaching them as a potential threat and there is a high probability their mother is nearby and she will defend her cubs fiercely. Along with their teeth and claws both members are capable of delivering painful burns with their Fire type attacks and as such even from a distance these two Pokémon should be treated with caution.
<p></p><h2>Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Members of this line spend much of their time resting,  up to 20 hours a day are spent lazing around. Though they may be active at any point in the day dusk is the most common time of peak activity. The Litleo line mostly live in prides made up of five or six female Pyroar,  their Litleo cubs of both sexes and one maybe two male Pyroar. At two-three years of age male Litleo cubs are excluded from their maternal pride and become nomads. Nomads wander great distances either alone or in pairs which are often made up of brothers. Usually these males will form a pride of their own with a group of females all of whom are related to each other.
<p></p>The male/s of a pride tend to stay on the fringes of the pride area and patrol its boarders. Most of the hunting within a pride is done by the females who are swifter and more agile as they are unencumbered by the heavy conspicuous mane of the males.
<p></p><h2>Courting</h2>
<p></p>While both members of this line are capable of breeding in captivity in the wild it is usually only Pyroar who breed. Most females will have reproduced by the time they reach four years of age. The members of the Litleo line dont have any specific time of year that they mate and can do so at any time of year. The males will breed with all the females of mating age within their pride and may do so twenty to forty times per day.
<p></p>The female undergoes an approximately 110 day gestation cycle before giving birth to 1-4 cubs in a secluded den. The mother will generally not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride before the cubs are six to eight weeks old though may do so in some situations,  usually if one or more of the other females has also recently given birth. In these situations the females will cooperate in the raising and suckling of the cubs. Cubs are usually weaned from their mother at six to seven months of age.
<p></p><h2>In Human Society</h2>
The members of the Litleo line are one of the most beloved Pokémon to appear in human culture due to their regal and noble appearance. Male Pyroar were one of the most common emblems in the heraldry of medieval Kalos symbolising bravery,  strength,  valour,  royalty and more.
In more recent media depictions the Litleo line made up a sizeable amount of the cast in a <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing'>beloved childrens movie</a>  and a cowardly Pyroar was a companion to the main character in a <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWizardofOz' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWizardofOz'>fantasy novel</a> who finally finds his courage.

</div>A question on the Pokemon League. The franchise has it set up akin to a sports leauge,  with each region or regions grouped into conferences,  like how the NCAA has the MEAC and Big Ten and such.
<p></p>well what I'm saying is how much of the Pokemon game mechanics are actually game mechanics? That is,  as Polemon training is a sport in universe,  a lot of the more outright gamey stuff would easily make sense as in universe rules.
<p></p>Like type classifications,  they're not based on the actual biology (given Egg Groups cover that ) but it would make sense that they are PL classifications put on by the leagues.
<p></p>thus explaining type shift ups and the like as new info leads to new rules .
<p></p>So,  in that way,  how do you think a Pokemon League article would be set up .

<p></p>A couple of the entries are just plain <strong>wrong</strong>,  saying things that are directly contradicted by the source material. The entry for the Grimer line falsely claims that Grimers explode when they're ignited,  while an old edit wrongly claimed that they needed a special type of Poke Ball to be caught. The Slugma entry wrongly claims that they are dangerous just to be around because of the heat in their bodies,  when we know from every canon continuity available that is plainly not the case. The Slugma entry even claims that Professor Elm's entry in the Pokedex is wrong-saying that Fanon is somehow more correct than Game Freak's own source material?
<p></p>Why are these things still in the Pokedex,  much less written in the first place? This is a great idea,  and I'm quite interested in contributing myself,  but I don't get why the Pokedex has stuff that we can plainly see is not accurate.

</div>Well,  the answer is twofold.
<p></p>1. Those articles are kinda old,  somewhat subject to <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness'>Early-Installment Weirdness</a>,  and no one's had a chance to update them.
<p></p>2. While we do use elements from different aspects of canon and try to stick to the canon series as closely as possible,  we are not beholden to the canon and can contradict it when it comes to cases of irreconcilable logical/logistical issues. (ie. Magcargo being a sustained twice as hot as the surface of the sun and somehow not killing everything around it.)
<p></p>If you'd like more information about how we work,  here's our <a class='urllink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=rmvjixctp256gfq3p86y66ma&amp;page=145#3609'>style manual<img src="http://static.mediatropes.info/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;" /></a>

I've looked through the various Pokedex entries on Serebii.net,  and all I find are references to things like it being able to move at 50 mph and it having a magnet in its brain.
<p></p>As for things like Slugmas being too dangerous to handle,  I would suggest that they can simply control their heat levels in much the same way that Grimers control their poison levels. Alternately,  since so much of its shell is cooled magma that fragments easily according to various Pokedex entries,  perhaps Magcargo grows the shell as a means of regulating its internal body temparature and keeping it from turning everything around it into slag? Just as the shell is constantly flaking off,  excess magma and body heat are continually coming out and hardening,  replacing the pieces of shell that it loses? This would account for why flames occasionally spout out of its body and why its shell never seems to break despite being so brittle.

</div>In his defence at times the dex has gotten a bit "Hollywood" with the entries. Some that border on being ashamed of the source material. I mean of course it turns our autism on to find explanations and back stories for all the wonderful weirdness of the Pokemon world,  but we shouldn't feel compelled to go "oh this is stupid" and blanket it all out in an eternal quest for "grittiness and realism."
<p></p>the way I see it,  realism should serve the source material rather than overwrite it,  that is,  the first option should be to use real world logic and science to explain,  and expand upon  the nature of the work as presented.
<p></p>Take the recent Aegislash example. A writer,  with very good skills,  made attempt to explain away that lines soul absorbing powers as blood sucking.
<p></p>However,  he was not aware of a previous article. The Litwick line. That article,  based on the actual electromagnetic impulses that make up living creatures brains (and thus what may be termed a "soul")noted that in the Pokemon universe,  soul eating would be a logical extension of the settings nature. From there ir used science to further connect and enrich the setting as opposed to ignoring it. Giving soul eating a biology based name,  drawing a comparison between this and its habitat,  noting the potential connections between its candle like structure and evolution sequence; all use critical thinking and analysis to paint a picture that work in whole. In short,  rather than try to explain how would work in the real world,  we should be explaining how reality would work in the Pokemon world.
Couple that with the wide variety of source to pull from and we should have no problem.

<p></p>I actually think that it's perfectly valid to have some elements of the Pokedex be attributable to folklore or exaggeration. For the example that you brought up with Litwick,  it raises two questions: A: How on earth do you materially <em>quantify</em> that a "soul-eater" has a soul to properly eat given their immaterial nature? B: If you have an entity which feeds off of souls indiscriminately,  including human souls,  how on earth did the thing ever become legal to train? And how was there ever a movement to try and find a "soul substitute" rather than just writing the creature off as too dangerous to bother with?
<p></p>That's not to say that the 'dex entries are to be thrown out wholesale. After all,  if a Pokemon has a reputation of eating souls or being a psychopomp,  it must do <em>something</em> that would give the impression,  since behind every myth is a half-truth.
<p></p>Are there articles that are presently hosted that don't integrate canon as well as they could to explain behaviors well? Undoubtedly. However,  there's also a number of articles that take Pokedex entries at face value and don't do an adequate job of explaining what logically follows from a literal reading of those entries,  which is also undesirable.
<p></p><img src="http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/smiles/arrow_up.png" alt="[up]" title="[up]" height="16" width="16" />
<p></p>I am fine with reverting the page and asking Gumgrapes via PM to post a formal claim on the article in this thread to revise it. We have proper channels for a reason,  and it would not be overly hard for Gumgrapes to restore his/her work afterwards.

<p></p>For future reference,  all that's really needed to do prior to making a new article or edit is to stake a formal claim,  since it prevents conflicts of work and vandalism. For editing,  you want to ideally check if the article has been inactive long enough,  which does not strike me as being an issue for Heracross' article since it's like 2 years old if I remember right.
<p></p>But yeah,  unless someone wishes to correct me,  I believe that it would be appropriate for you to restore your edits to the Heracross article now.

Since I've gotten no response,  I thought I'd post my updated take on this entry:</em>
<p></p><h1> Slugma Line</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Slugma [#218]
</li></ul>o Slugma is a large,  bulky mollusk -at least as gastropods go- reaching up to 70cm tall at the head when it draws itself up. While mildly interesting based on size,  Slugma's most striking characteristic is that its body is constantly glowing due to the unique nature of its circulatory system (see below). Slugma constantly glows a deep,  rich red-orange,  most noticeably in the dark. When they are exposed to considerable amounts of moisture,  it evaporates instantly,  bursting into steam and fog. Despite their slow speed and bodies,  they are always moving. Rare cases are reported where Slugma take on a grey coloration; this may be due to impurities in their silicate bodies.
<p></p><ul ><li> Magcargo [#219]
</li></ul>o The next stage in Slugma's life is distinguishable by a large,  bulky "shell" of hardened skin stationed upon its back,  which is in fact skin that hardens as it cools,  with internal organs and circulatory systems that extend well into the heart of the shell. Pieces of this shell are constantly flaking and breaking off,  often leaving a trail of soot-like debris in the Magcargo's wake. Flames will occasionally erupt from gaps in the shell as new skin grows and hardens on contact with air,  causing the "shell" to constantly renew itself The rare "impurity" morphs are notable for varying shades of blue and purple.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>Slugma and Magcargo are almost unique among Pokemon in that they have material other than blood in their circulatory systems. While some Pokemon species do not have circulatory systems at all (such as the Grimer and Magnemite species),  the Slugma species is the only one to have real,  actual lava flowing through its veins. Based on autopsies of deceased specimens,  these creatures are primarily composed of silicate matter and various other amounts of igneous materials and minerals that vary by location. This would account for the Rock-type characteristics that the species exhibits upon evolution,  and also possibly for the fact that these creatures do not seem to need to have their magma "blood" circulate oxygen,  water or glucose circulated through their bodies the way blood does for humans and the vast majority of Pokemon species.
<p></p>Living specimens have been shown to be very hot to the touch,  well above 100 degrees Celsius,  as evidenced by water being turned into steam on contact. Some species also sometimes cause serious burns on contact. However,  autopsies of deceased specimens have found that their internal temperatures are considerably hotter,  with some calculations suggesting that live specimens may have internal temperatures as high as 18, 000 degrees Farenheit,  at least when they evolve to the Magcargo stage. However,  it must be emphasized that this is only a calculation,  as Slugma rapidly cool when they stop moving,  a trait that is only accelerated by death.
<p></p>Further analysis has also shown that Slugma's skin is both extremely flexible and extremely resistant to damage. In part,  this accounts for their ability to move comfortably through the often rocky and rough terrain they inhabit,  but it is also shown to be highly effective in regulating their external body temperature. Further evidence of this is demonstrated by a Slugma's evolution into a Magcargo. Evolution causes a Slugma's internal temperature to rise even more than before,  and the newly evolved Magcargo hardens a large portion of its skin into a shell that cools on contact with air,  before weakening and breaking off. Skin and heat are constantly disposed of both through the cooled skin and the flames that occasionally erupt as new skin grows in,  allowing the Magcargo to regulate its temperature of its body.
<p></p>Finally,  one may note that Slugma and Magcargo do not sleep. This allows them to continuously circulate the magma within their bodies,  as they will start to cool if they stop moving. In combination with their growing shells,  the constant motion allows Slugma to maintain homeostasis in regards to their body temperature.
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>While both Slugma and Magcargo are lithophages (discussed later),  they also require considerable amounts of heat,  especially Slugma,  which depends on geothermal vents for most of its heat intake to break down rock as well as breed. Both Slugma and Magcargo,  as gastropod mollusks,  are hermaphroditic,  though this is considerably less pronounced than in most. They tend to follow a more "male-shifted" or "female-shifted" physiology,  the only real difference between the two being sperm vs. egg counts.
<p></p>A Slugma or Magcargo heavy with eggs will display them in large,  thick bubbles upon its shell which incubate the eggs while rotating them gently to ensure proper temperature regulation. This phenomenon is known as being "in plume,  " as the reproduction takes place with bursts of lava when the young have reached survival capability. Most of the hordes of young will harden and die,  but those that survive keep close to other Slugma or Magcargo,  but out of the way of their rasping radula to avoid being inadvertently eaten.
<p></p>There was one case of a plume coinciding with a Numel/Camerupt migration wherein a young Slugma made itself very comfortable inside the cauldron-like humps of the bull Camerupt and irritated it by chewing on its rocky protrusions.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Slugma are more dependent on location than Magcargo - an important part of their lifecycle. As they are smaller and less well-insulated,  Slugma must spend their time in habitats rich in both geothermal activity as well as mineral resources.
<p></p>Both Slugma and Magcargo are prolific in locations where geothermal activity is highest,  and a satellite map of zones where plates meet will invariably coincide with a distribution map of Slugma/Magcargo populations. Colonies have been found on remote volcanic islands with no indication of how they arrived,  for example. It has been suggested that Slugma travel through the Earth's mantle to reach new areas,  although this only rarely done,  possibly due to the need to maintain homeostasis in their bodies.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Both creature-types are primarily lithophages; that is,  their primary matter intake is rock,  which is slowly digested,  broken down by their internal heat. The choice elements and minerals are absorbed and the waste products left behind as flakes of obsidian or lumps of granite. They are also attracted to sources of heat-trainers have reported that their Slugma will slowly walk around campfires or even on hot stoves,  relishing the heat even if they do not consume it.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Slugma are not recommended for beginning trainers. Touching them can cause painful,  although rarely fatal,  burns,  and trainers may also be burned by the occasional burst of flame from a Magcargo's shell. However,  they can be caught and stored in Poke Balls like any other Pokemon,  and can be perfectly safe if the trainer knows how to handle them. Although <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionShmonvection' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvectionShmonvection'>the hot air around lava flows and volcanoes</a> can prove very painful and even fatal to humans,  the species' flexible and durable skins,  as well as the shells developed by Magcargos,  allows them to regulate their internal temperatures so that they generally pose no hazard to their surroundings unless actually touched. Trainers can use this to their advantage in Pokemon battles,  as some Slugma can cause burns to any opponent that physically contacts them while attacking,  while others will immediately thaw out of any attempt to freeze them.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure and Interactions with Others</h2>
<p></p>Slugma and Magcargo tend to live in large colonies,  though they are not particularly social creatures in and of themselves. As volcanic activity is unrelated to seasonal change,  they can be found outdoors even in the winter so long as their surrounding temperature remains high. In particularly harsh conditions,  Slugma may congregate around the colony's Magcargo,  huddling together in an amorphous pile for warmth and heat.
<p></p>Due to their habitat,  Slugma and Magcargo rarely interact with many other Pokemon. Geodude occasionally wander around and reactions are generally mild until the gastropods attempt to rasp off a section of rocky skin. At this point,  the Geodude generally flees,  these being some of the few creatures it can outrun. Machop enjoy throwing small rocks at them and often compete amongst themselves to see how many they can hit. The Slugma tend to retreat behind larger and tougher Magcargo,  which will discourage the Machop if struck.
<p></p>Numel and Camerupt are an interesting case,  and some speculate that their internal magma reservoirs are powered by microcolonies of Slugma feeding upon their rocky interiors. It may be becoming somewhat more discredited with the discovery that only Magcargo have such internal furnaces,  though it is entirely possible that a different strain exists in a state symbiotic solely with Camerupt,  similar to the clearly mutant Shellder existing with Slowbro.
<p></p><em>I find that this meshes much better with both the canon material (e.g.,  the Pokedex entries about Slugma not sleeping) and also better incorporates various elements of the style guide,  such as incorporating game quirks,  and it being much more consistent with what we see in the games,  anime and so forth. Once again,  I tried contacting Isotroper,  and I got nothing in reply.</em>

<p></p><h1> Goldeen Line</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Goldeen [#118]
</li><li> Seaking [#119]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>Goldeen are a species of fish typically about two feet in length,  with white skin and orange coloring the length of the top of their bodies,  and also halfway along their fins. Their eyes are typically a bright blue in color,  and they have round,  feminine-looking lips,  even on male examples of the species. A bone horn extends from their forehead above their eyes.
<p></p>Seaking are considerably larger,  being over four feet in length and considerably more colorful. Their bodies are primarily golden orange in color with black patterns on their flanks,  and a white patch on their underbelly below their face. Their horn is considerably longer and larger,  and their fins are entirely white with black markings.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>Goldeen are known for their elegant and graceful way of swimming,  as their fins wave majestically in the water and they carry themselves with considerable grace. This has led the species to be nicknamed the "Water Queen" or the "water dancer",  a trait shared by both female and male members of the species. They are also remarkably fast for their size,  typically swimming at five knots upstream and even up waterfalls. Their skill in navigating waterfalls is so intense,  in fact,  that they are one of the few Pokemon species to learn the "Waterfall" ability on their own without being trained by an external source like a Technical Machine. They are migratory in nature,  swimming to particular areas to spawn in the autumn and remaining there through the winter,  before returning in the spring to their summer habitats. Goldeen travel in large schools,  creating a lovely gold and white pattern that causes the water to reflect beautifully off sunrises and sunsets.
<p></p>Goldeen are also known for preferring to swim in large areas. They have been known to break out of aquariums using their horns,  even if they end up on dry land afterwards. Some Goldeen cannot navigate outside of the water,  and will simply flail helplessly about. Other Goldeen are surprisingly agile,  and have shown themselves able to navigate even in mountain and forest areas as skilfully as if they are in the water.
<p></p>Seakings are even more powerful swimmers than Goldeens,  and their horns are considerably stronger,  to the point that they can even crush stone. When Goldeen schools settle in an area for the winter or summer,  the Seakings among them will use their horns to drill holes in streamside boulders that the Goldeen will use as nests.
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>Goldeen spawn in the fall,  gathering in large numbers to choose mates and breed. While spawning females may be either Goldeens or Seakings,  Seakings are almost always the only males of the species who will breed. Mates are frequently chosen based on their ability to carve nests with their horns,  and their ability to defend their nests from predators. Male Seakings try to become as fatty as possible,  since <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength'>their larger bulk makes them physically stronger.</a>
<p></p>This species is very aggressive in protecting its eggs,  and will resort to considerable violence to protect them as needed from predators or even any human or other species of Pokemon unlucky enough to get too close. Swimmers and even boaters have reported being attacked,  although enterprising trainers and other fishermen seeking to catch a Goldeen noted that this is an ideal time to do so.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Goldeen and Seaking typically inhabit rivers and lakes in temperate to subtropical zones in a wide variety of terrains ranging from forests to prairies to mountains. They are equally likely to be found in bodies of water on the surface,  or in underground lakes and rivers in caves. They typically only dwell in fresh water,  and are rarely if ever found at sea.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Goldeen are omnivorous,  typically feeding on plant matter in their lake and river habitats. They occasionally feed on certain other types of Water Pokemon,  such as the Lotad,  Surskit,  Clamperl,  Tympole and Luvdisc species,  although they are not aggressive hunters and only feed on the basic morphs of the species. Rarely,  they will feed on other type of Pokemon that they attack and kill while defending their nests,  although this is typically not done and most predators will flee before being killed.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure and Interactions with Others</h2>
<p></p>As noted,  Goldeen converge in large schools. These schools are typically led by the Seakings among them,  although there does not appear to be any major hierarchy between the Seakings themselves. They appear to be guided primarily by shared instinct and rarely fight. The sole exception is during spawning season,  when male Seakings will occasionally engage in non-fatal sparring matches in an attempt to win over female mates.
<p></p>While traveling,  they are typically content to ignore other Pokemon,  although they will defend themselves against anything that is hostile. They will also violently attack anything that appears to threaten their eggs during spawning season. They usually only prey on wild Pokemon when the plants they typically eat are in short supply,  or if the other Pokemon attempted to prey,  or were even just assumed to be wanting to prey,  on the Goldeens' eggs.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Goldeen and especially Seaking can be <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear'>especially</a> <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf'>violent</a> when protecting their spawning nests. The horns of Goldeen can cause painful bruising,  while the horns of Seakings can cause injuries requiring hospitalization and even sometimes deaths in a few isolated cases. Fortunately,  this usually only occurs during the autumn spawning season,  and humans are well advised to avoid swimming or boating in the red-hued lakes where these Pokemon gather. If you try to catch a Goldeen or a Seaking during spawning season,  you are best advised to use a fishing rod to get the Pokemon out of the water and onto land,  where it will be difficult for the other Pokemon to reach you.
<p></p>If you are unlucky enough to be accidentally caught in a lake full of spawning Goldeens and Seakings,  it is usually advisable to try and escape as soon as possible. The Pokemon will typically leave you alone if you make it clear that you are leaving their territory.

<p></p><strong>General Characteristics</strong>
The Dragon type is a difficult type to define. Most of the other types either revolve around an element that a Pokémon can control,  or their general morphology. However,  both the appearances of Dragons and their methods of attack are found to be quite varied and ambiguous in nature. It is currently believed that there are two important criteria for classifying Dragon-types,  a tough hide and the presence of a unique variant of the omnisac,  the organ used for generating the unique energy used in all Dragon-typed attacks.
<p></p><strong>Powers</strong>
Dragon-types are one of the most feared and sought after Pokémon,  and for good reason. Dragons possess both offensive and defensive advantages over other types. The energy produced by a Dragon's omnisac is very pure and unlike any other element,  rarely having adverse reactions to other Pokémon's armor,  hides or mind-created fields. The exception to this is the tough armor of Steel-types,  which are the only material that can partially absorb Dragon energy. Every Dragons' signature hide is also surprisingly reactive to this draconian energy,  which has been observed to literally evaporate when in contact with said energy.
<p></p>On the topic of a Dragon-type's hide,  it has been observed to be resistant to a wide range of elements. It is a good insulator of heat and electricity,  protecting the Dragon's innards from taking excessive damage through these sources. It has additionally shown to be very unreactive to water as well as most organic compounds,  rendering these kinds of attacks ineffective as well. However,  it is well known to be vulnerable to extreme cold,  as well as the attacks of Dragon brethren. All in all,  Dragon-types possess many strengths and few weaknesses,  making them a popular choice among elite trainers.
<p></p>Recently,  a Kalos-based research team has discovered a completely new elemental type. Coined the "Fairy" type due to the morphology of the Pokémon that belongs in it,  their attacks pierce right through a Dragon's hide,  while they have been observed to possess a weak aura that completely negates Draconian energy. It has been speculated that this new type is an evolutionary countermeasure for common prey of Dragon-types.
<p></p><strong>Morphology</strong>
Dragon-types have a fairly varied range of appearances,  but most of them exhibit reptilian traits. Most Dragons are actually quite dissimilar to the traditional depiction of dragons in folklore. This is because the Dragon type was first coined to classify Dragonite,  one of the earliest Dragon-types discovered. Many Dragons seem to resemble prehistoric dinosaur Pokémon,  and are widely considered as living fossils. This theory is supported by the Tyrantrum line,  which are actual fossilized Dragon-type Pokémon.
<p></p><strong>Diet</strong>
A majority of Dragon types are carnivores or omnivores,  and in the latter case,  most prefer meat over vegetation. Many Dragon Pokémon are capable predators,  and have been known to hunt large prey by themselves.
<p></p><strong>Breeding</strong>
As many Dragon Pokémon are solitary and elusive,  mating practices are not well understood. Males are known to fight for a mate whenever there is competition.
<p></p>My first contribution to the dex. Criticism and suggestions are appreciated.

</div>I decided to give this another shot,  since dibs are apparently still on. (Wait,  what?)
<p></p>The whole paralysis thing is a reference to the TCG cards,  where Confusion has been few times (dunno how many exactly) translated as Psyshock,  and is capable of causing paralysis.
<p></p><h2>Psyshock</h2>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<ul ><li>Type: Psychic
</li><li>Category: Mixed
</li><li>Strength (in BP units): 80
</li></ul><h3>Description</h3>
The user forms an orb of psychic energy that is then fired at the target. The orb explodes upon contact.
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
As with most of the damaging Psychic-type moves,  this move is performed by using the user's psychic energy. In this case,  the psychic energy is compressed in a small,  dense orblike shape that is clearly visible to a naked eye. Studies have shown that this is not the usual type of psychic energy used for most of the moves. This might explain the fact that upon collision,  the orb instantly converts into heat and energy. This creates an explosion with accompanying shockwave.
<p></p>As common knowledge would suggest,  most of the Pokémon shown capable of learning the move are known to have some sort of psychic abilities to smaller or larger degree,  such as Psyduck or Abra. Since the power of the explosion is dependent on the amount of the psychic energy that's put into the orb,  the blow can be softened by putting up a Light Screen.
<p></p>Some Trainers have reported that under rare,  unknown circumstances,  this move will cause the hit parts of body to numb down as if they were paralyzed. It is unknown if Pokémon immune to the paralysis ailment are affected by this rare side effect.
<h3>Hazards (Hazard Level:6/10)</h3>
The Psyshock attack poses a different threat than most of the Psychic-type moves. Due to move's explosive nature,  the move should be used carefully,  as the released shockwave can damage or change nearby surroundings in one or another way. The case of buildings collapsing due to misaims or mistreating are known. One may want to carry an object made of tin,  as this kind of metal is known to absorb the psychic energy,  or have a Bug-,  Dark- or Ghost-type Pokémon with them,  which can help reduce the damage that's about to occur.
<p></p>The greatest danger lies in the user's experience (or lack of thereof). For the move to work correctly,  the user has to compress its psychic energy in a small,  concentrated orb. A trained Pokémon will be able to do it without larger problems. However,  an inexperienced specimen might not be able to properly use its psychic abilities to form the orb. In the best case,  the psychic energy will simply fail to concentrate as supposed,  instead being harmlessly released. In the worst case,  the orb will overcharge,  causing an instant explosion,  injuring the Pokémon and anything within close enough proximity.
<p></p>There is also danger of the aforementioned paralysis-like effect,  but since it is so rare,  not much is currently known about it. Currently,  scientists are performing extensive researches on that matter.
