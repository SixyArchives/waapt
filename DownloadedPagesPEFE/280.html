</div>I mentioned it about three pages back. I asked if anyone had dibsed it,  and nobody had so i dibsed in in my next post.
<p></p>Anyway,  Bellsprout revamp! (No In Popular Culture section due to time constraints)
<p></p><h1> Bellsprout Line</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Bellsprout [#069]
</li><li> Weepinbell [#070]
</li><li> Victreebel [#071] [NOTE: This morph should properly be called 'Victreebell',  but limits on the technology at the time of discovery have caused this abbreviated version to pass into common usage. The expected spelling is used below to avoid confusion.]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>The bellsprout line are a family of grass/poison pokemon native to swamps and tropical forests. Their most distinctive feature is the 'bell' for which they are named. This bell,  while resembling the instrument,  is actually an oversized,  adapted leaf that acts as their primary method of capturing prey.
<p></p>Within this bell they produce two kinds of liquids. The most notable of these is an acidic compound that is both their primary method of dissolving food and primary method of defence. When irritated,  the members of this line have a tendency to 'vomit' this acid at the offending party.
<p></p>The second of these liquids is produced in lesser quantities,  and prevents the acid from dissolving the walls of the bell. This compound is so effective at its job that it has become the basis for most acid-neutralizing formulas in the modern world.
<p></p>The bellsprout line has adapted to the low-light conditions below the canopy of forests,  so when members of this species are exposed to strong sunlight,  they photosynthesize much more efficiently. Trained members of this speices are willing to expend more energy in this state,  moving and attacking much faster. A minority of individuals lack this adaption,  having to catch much more prey to make up for this deficiency.
<p></p>Bellsprout is the juvenile of the line,  and feeds on small insects which it traps in its vines. It can also,  like normal plants,  gain food from photosynthesis,  as it has two falcate leaves on either side of its vine 'body'. However,  it still needs to catch and eat prey on a regular basis. Bellsprout's defining feature is its ability to run on its stiff roots. This,  combined with its accuracy at flinging its vine,  makes bellsprout an efficient predator. This same flexibility also makes it extremely difficult to hit.
<p></p>After about two years,  bellsprout will hook itself onto a root or branch by its vine and evolve into weepinbell. In this form,  it has lost most of its vine,  what remains is topped by a short,  wooden 'hook'. Weepinbell may be observed 'hopping' on this hook,  but this is an extremely inefficient method of locomotion.  The weepinbell instead takes up life as a sedentary hunter. [Trainer's Note: Your newly-evolved weepinbell may dislike this stage of relative immobility. Allow it to ride either on your shoulder or on a sufficiently large pokemon and this will soon pass.]
<p></p>Its bell is larger,  allowing it to eat larger prey. It acid is now also stronger,  and while reports of it dissolving steel are a little far-fetched,  weepinbell's acid is more than capable of dissolving flesh (see Hazards). Weepinbell will attempt to eat anything that walks past by spitting this acid and drawing the victim into its mouth.
<p></p>It retains the falcate leaves it had in its previous form,  but these are now located on either side of the bell. These leaves are used to cut larger meals down into chunks small enough to be digested. This ability has been dubbed 'Razor Leaf' by the trainer community,  and is a staple battling technique.
<p></p>Many weepinbell remain in this stage for the remainder of their lives,  but those who are exposed to radiation from a Leaf Stone evolve into victreebel. As a victreebel,  they are significantly larger and heavier. They now rest with the mouth of their bell upwards. To prevent rain from filling the bell,  victreebel has grown a three-lobed leaf 'lid' which they can close over their bells.
<p></p>Along with this,  the vine they possessed in previous forms has migrated to the top of the bell,  which they can use as a prehensile limb. Victreebel have been observed moving with an awkward hopping,  but these pokemon often retain the sedentary lifestyle of their previous form. Nevertheless,  they remain deadly predators. Now equipped with four sharp,  wooden 'teeth',  they attract prey with sweet scented acid,  then clamp down,  trapping the prey inside their bell.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>The bellsprout line can be found in forests and swamps of Kanto and Johto,  with sightings in Sinnoh. Bellsprout are often seen running along the forest floor,  either in pursuit of prey or being pursued by predators.
<p></p>Weepinbell can be found in bushes and trees,  patiently waiting for prey to come by. Occasionally a weepinbell will fall out of its perch onto the forest floor. They will generally make their way into a bush or area of long grass where they can hide. If a weepinbell's bell fills with rain,  a mankey or primeape may take the weepinbell and drink from it.
<p></p>Victreebel can be found near their preevolutions,  and are rumoured to live in colonies deep within the heart of forests. However,  most scientists and trainers who have set out to confirm these rumours haven't returned.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Unabashedly carnivorous.
<p></p>The diet of any member of the bellsprout line is limited by what they can reasonably fit within their bell. Bellsprout eats insects,  and will often chase a prey item that catches their eye and dodges their vine.
<p></p>Weepinbell will take small animals in addition to insects. Rattata and ledyba seem to be common targets,  many having been found eaten by these pokemon. Larger pokemon have also been subdued and eaten by blundering into an area particularly thick with weepinbell.
<p></p>Victreebel will eat almost anything,  even some pokemon the same size as them. Persistent rumours have victreebel eating unwary trainers,  but this may merely be brought about by victreebel's habit of 'hugging' people it is particularly fond of by clamping them between its leaf and 'mouth'.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>The bellsprout line has a number of hazards which the prospective trainer must prepare for. Firstly,  every member of the line produces sweet-smelling acid within their bell. while this acid in bellsprout is little more than a lure,  in the later members of the line it can inflict painful chemical burns.
<p></p>While most trained members of this line have control over the amount of acid they use in a typical attack,  wild varieties don't,  and will attack at the slightest provocation. Thick fabrics are a must when travelling through areas known to be weepinbell habitats.
<p></p>While secondary to their acid,  the leaves of the bellsprout line have stiff,  serrulate margins,  and many members can whip up a storm of these razor-edged leaves if they feel threatened. Again,  these scale with evolutionary level. While a bellsprout can inflict little more than a papercut,  Victreebel are able to cut to the bone if sufficiently pressed.
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>All forms of the bellsprout line are capable of breeding,  though most breeding in the wild is done by victreebel. Female victreebel will develop two to three bright red flowers,  and a male will fertilize them by transferring pollen using his vine. The eggs are then deposited in a secluded place. The eggs are then abandoned,  with the bellsprout hatching two weeks later.
<p></p>In habitats without victreebel,  it has been found that weepinbell take over the breeding role. Weepinbell ready to mate will grow a small flower on their vine similar to that of victreebel. They will then extend that blossom up above their bells,  enticing pollinators away from their bell. After pollination,  female weepinbell usually grow and drop a single egg. This egg is not actively cared for,  but the mother's presence does add a level of security for the juvenile bellsprout.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>The members of the bellsprout line are generally solitary. Several bellsprout running around independantly of each other is be a common sight within the forests of Kanto and Johto. While Weepinbell have been known to exhibit cooperative behaviour in large groups,  these are mostly accidental,  with no additional social behaviour noted.
<p></p>However,  on occasion victreebel has been seen providing weepinbell with leaf stones,  allowing them to evolve. It is unclear whether this is a case of intentional behaviour or merely instinct. As censuses of victreebel within controlled populations are usually stable,  it has been theorised that these victreebel are those close to death,  and are replacing themselves.
<p></p>This theory goes on to state that this may be evidence of a hierarchical community within the weepinbell and victreebel stages of the line. No other evidence for this theory has been reliably observed; all psychic pokemon that attempt to establish communication with a wild victreebel are swiftly attacked and eaten. (Is that too much?)

<p></p><h1> Duskull Line</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Duskull [#355]
<p></p></li><li> Dusclops [#356]
<p></p></li><li> Dusknoir [#477]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>The creatures of the Duskull line are Pokémon with a long-standing association with the underworld in many cultures that are characterized by rounded,  predominantly gray bodies that are noted to feel warm and cloth-like to the touch in a corporeal state,  with bone-like or otherwise bone-shaped protrusions and singular red "eyes".
<p></p>The first stage,  Duskull,  is a round,  floating Pokémon that is typically around 80 centimeters tall. Although these creatures are noted to have an average weight of 15 kilograms,  it should be noted that this figure represents an observed <em>upper bound</em> on Duskull weight,  an individual Duskull can weigh significantly <em>less</em> than this given figure depending upon how incorporeal of a state it assumes. Duskull possesses a tail that extends below its body,  a tuft on the top of its head,  two arms that fold back onto its back. and a bone-like faceplate that vaguely resembles a human skull. Its single red eye is suspended within its body,  and it floats between the two eye sockets rapidly. A distinctive marking on its back resembles a pair of bones.
<p></p>The second stage,  Dusclops,  is on average a 160 centimeter tall bipedal Pokémon,  with a dramatically larger observed average upper bound for individual weight at slightly over 30 kilograms. Dusclops' appearance changes dramatically with evolution,  with banded markings up and down its entire body. Its white hands are detached from its body,  much like those of Haunter. Two white streamers extend from its shoulders,  trailing behind the Pokémon,  with a very similar tuft on top of the head. Its legs are trunklike,  and it has toothlike growths just above its mouth. Its red "eye" is now fixed and adopts a fleshy appearance,  seemingly surrounded by a white sclera.
<p></p>The third stage,  Dusknoir,  adopts a form that is vaguely anthropodal from the waist up,  with a tail similar to that of its first stage instead of legs. Its arms are well-developed now,  with glove-like hands and three yellow bands along their length. Its head features a six-pronged collar surrounding a central cranium containing the eye,  with a yellow band on what would be the forehead in a human,  and a yellow antenna on top. The body has yellow ridges that form markings similar to a smiling face on the back and a frowning face on the front; the latter is hinged and can open like an actual jaw. Typical Dusknoir will "stand" roughly 220 centimeters tall and possess a weight of almost 110 kilograms when fully incorporeal.
<p></p>Carriers of aberrant phenotypes are occasionally noted among Duskull and its evolutions. Such individuals are typically possess regions that are blood-red instead of grey in the first two stages,  with Duskull in this group noted to have slightly paler "bones" and Dusclops in this group noted to have a more vividly colored "eye." As Dusknoir,  such individuals posses deep blue bodies with brighter yellow markings. Trainers are known to go to great lengths to secure one of these specimens,  and they are believed amongst some channellers to have special paranormal properties.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>As creatures,  Duskull and its evolutions are noted to display heavy paranormal properties. As such,  these creatures are presently better understood in terms of their abilities,  with the actual nature of how their abilities operate by and large remaining an enigma.
<p></p>Like most other so-called "Ghost Pokémon, " creatures from this line are known to be capable of switching between states of various corporeality and incorporeality at will,  and are capable of phasing partly or entirely through thick walls in order to elude attackers or otherwise stalk prey. As with most other Ghost Pokémon,  Duskull and its evolutions have no presently known upper bound for their lifespans,  with a number of individuals possessing documented lifespans of hundreds of years,  and unverified reports of individuals who may have been living for far longer.
<p></p>Although known for their incredible resilience and ability to weather attacks that would seriously injure other Pokémon without much harm,  Duskull and its evolutions are by no means impervious,  let alone immortal. Duskull and its brethren are very much mortal,  and like other creatures,  can be seriously wounded or die if subjected to a sufficiently powerful assault. Such events are generally uncommon,  with the only things known to reliably kill these creatures consisting of exceptionally powerful umbrate-based attacks,  and attacks on the power level of an entity such as a Legendary Pokémon. Curiously,  a Duskull's body appears to rapidly degrade after death,  and will disappate entirely without any detectable trace over the course of just a few hours.
<p></p>It is presently theorized that the latter two stages of this line have pseudo-omnisacs that allow them to use cold,  heat,  and electricity-infused punches,  although attempts to verify this matter have proven fruitless so far,  further compounded by the rapid degradation of these creatures' remains. They are also capable of using umbrate to deliver enhanced punches,  attacking with speedy,  shadowy tendrils,  and even sending superheated balls of gas to burn the opponent.
<p></p>Interestingly,  Duskull line members exhibit properties that have led some researchers to postulate that these creatures may incorporate miniature localized black holes as part of their bodies. These are capable of absorbing various kinds of matter into their bodies,  with quantity varying by evolutionary stage (see Diet). When absorbing objects,  Duskull and its evolutions generate a vacuum-like inward force that is powerful enough to disturb nearby objects,  and among particularly powerful individuals,  appears to be capable of refracting light. These creatures are also capable of regurgitating absorbed matter (in the form of ash and gases) in a White Hole state,  which is often known as "ashing". Ashing appears to typically be triggered by states of extreme emotional stress,  in a manner not wholly unlike an Octillerys ink defense. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile" >You call that an ink defense? WHOOPWHOOPWHOOPWHOOP!</span>
<p></p>A number of other abilities have been documented amongst these creatures. One of the most peculiar is the apparent ability for creatures of the Duskull line to "possess" both organic beings and other Ghost-types,  with the latter being easier for the Pokémon as well as less dangerous for the host if the possessing entity is inexperienced. Both group possessions and chain possessions (Duskull line members possessing each other in turn,  then an organic host) have been recorded. A less paranormal ability documented among Duskull is its ability to suspend its body far off of the ground at will,  making most earth-based attacks ineffectual. Dusclops and Dusknoir lack this skill,  but have instead been documented emanating an aura that physically exhausts the foe faster and makes them more reluctant to attack that has been described as "psychologically oppressive." Dusclops appear to evolve by ingesting strange materials known as Reaper Cloths. Curiously,  Dusclops evolution appears to occur more reliably in settings with high amounts of background electromagnetic radiation. Analysis of these objects has yielded few answers,  but they appear often in places where Duskull line members are known to lurk,  and appear in some instances to be shed by Dusknoir.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>The Duskull line can,  theoretically live anywhere,  though its members appear to be most strongly attracted to places that give off strong fear and death auras. As such,  sites with high incidences of death such as particularly treacherous stretches of roads,  burial sites,  former battlefields,  or simply more mundane regions such as locations with high mortality rates among local creatures,  may find themselves host to such creatures. In settings around human habitation,  Duskull and its evolutions have a tendency to be sighted around graveyards,  hospitals,  butcher shops,  abandoned houses,  and other such places. In some regions,  members of this line have been known to congregate around movie theaters when a particularly frightening movie is being aired,  to feast on the accumulated emotions of fear from the moviegoers,  a phenomenon which is occasionally observed in and around the vicinity of Lilycove City in Hoenn.
<p></p>They are most frequently sighted in various locations in Hoenn and Sinnoh,  particularly places like the necropolises in Mt. Pyre and near the north of Route 209. Other sites that these creatures can be reliably encountered in these regions include Routes 121 and 123 in Hoenn,  with occasional sightings recorded on Routes 204 and 224 in Sinnoh. These creatures are also known to dwell in the vicinity of Hoenn's Sky Pillar and Sinnoh's Sendoff Spring,  their ties to these places remains unclear. Duskull and its evolutions are primarily nocturnal,  and rarely feed or otherwise engage in extensive activity during the day under wild settings.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Duskull opportunistically feed on both death aura and fear,  feeding both on ambient auras of these sensations,  as well pursuing victims to milk as much of the latter as possible. Creatures from this line are known to be particularly aggressive about their feedings at times,  and are occasionally seen harassing and pursuing creatures that are nearing death,  sometimes for entire nights,  or systemically stalking victims to feed on their fear over prolonged periods of time,  in a phenomenon that some anthropologists have suggested may be the origins of notions of "boogeymen" in some cultures. Like their evolutions,  they have some black-hole like qualities,  but not developed enough to absorb much more than the odd berry or table scrap.
<p></p>Dusclops,  on the other hand,  are far more indiscriminate eaters with pronounced black-hole like qualities. Dusclops are commonly seen consuming "foods" that other Pokémon feed on,  and while typically passive in their feeding behaviors,  have been known to hunt and consume prey. Theoretically,  a Dusclops could eat virtually anything,  with experiments involving Dusclops that were searching for an upper bound for absorbable object size finding that their subjects could absorb objects larger than small cars,  albeit slowly. Thankfully,  these creatures primarily feed on food items given to them by Trainers,  as well as the death aura the entire line craves.
<p></p>If the Dusknoir stage is reached,  these Pokémon feed primarily on death aura,  but in a pinch they can feed on the same "foods" as their less evolved forms. Curiously,  most Dusknoir appear to be indifferent,  if not leery of consuming "fear auras",  and some individuals exhibit marked distaste or disgust when made to feed off of them. Some researchers have suggested that these "fear auras" may be an intermediate food source for younger and generally weaker forms,  much in the same fashion in which a human's diet will alter dramatically with age.
<p></p>While theoretically immune to death by starvation,  being deprived of food will still affect these Pokémon negatively. Members of this line will exhibit disoriented and aggressive behavior and impaired phasing abilities if sufficiently deprived of food. It should be noted that physical foodstuffs are insufficient for fully nourishing these Pokémon,  even in the Dusclops stage,  with fear and death auras being necessary for their well-being,  a matter which should be accommodated for by any would-be trainers of these creatures.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Although their common depiction as generally malevolent spirits in popular culture is undoubtedly oversimplified,  and obfuscates the ability for these creatures to form deep and intimate bonds with their trainers,  it should go without saying that Duskull and its evolutions are by no means creatures to be taken lightly.
<p></p>Like all Ghost Pokémon,  the Duskull line is capable of powerful umbrate-based attacks,  notably in melee form. While these creatures are capable of assuming incorporeal states,  in a physical assault,  a hapless victim on the receiving end will find their physical presence to be anything <em>but</em> incorporeal. Injuries from such attacks are generally consistent with those of less paranormal physical assaults,  and depending on the strength of the assailant and the technique used,  may range from minor to moderate bruising,  to potentially massive internal bleeding and fragmented major bones. It should be noted that ranged umbrate-based attacks,  while less physically damaging,  also pose significant hazards to an imprudent trainer's well being,  with effects akin to that of a psychic assault. Creatures from this line have also been documented using burning,  freezing,  and electrocuting attacks under some circumstances,  which pose hazards similar to those utilized by more mundane users of such attacks.
<p></p>It is recommended not to startle any member of this line,  out of risk of being seriously injured by one of these attacks out of a panicked lashing out. Furthermore,  serious burns can also arise from being in the vicinity of one of these Pokémon during an ashing fear response. If a Duskull line member begins to show signs of said fear response,  it is highly recommended to immediately retreat to a safe distance away from the creature. Like most other creatures,  Duskull and its evolutions often have a limited tolerance for irony,  and may find being startled as creatures that <em>feed</em> on fear to be an affront to their dignity.
<p></p>Like most other Ghost Pokémon,  Duskull and its evolutions are generally not recommended for particularly young trainers,  or for trainers that are in regular contact with young children. Improperly trained members of this line may wind up deliberately startling children they are exposed to in order to feed on their fear,  which coupled with the often aggressive feeding patterns of creatures from this line,  may lead to a well-meaning Pokémon in this line inadvertently engaging in behavior analogous to bullying. Even with a properly trained member of this line,  a Duskull line member will pose inadvertant hazards to young children. It should be noted that the eye in all stages of this line appears to be closer to a ball of flame than a fleshy organ. Attempts to <em>poke</em> the eye all members display will likely result in serious burns. In addition,  the possession abilities of this line can also be dangerous,  since exiting the host body improperly (usually done by inexperienced members of this line) can cause serious harm to the former host. Side effects of botched possession vary widely,  but have been known to range from simple disorientation to lapsing into prolonged comatose states or that of sudden brain death in extreme cases. As such,  encouraging one's Duskull line member to possess other entities is highly discouraged,  for those seeking to let <em>themselves</em> act as mediums,  it is kindly suggested to look into <em>alternate</em> methods of courting suicide that are less likely to leave a husk of your body to linger on for some time afterwards.
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>All stages of the Duskull line are known to be capable of mating,  though courtship appears to be uncommon outside of the later two stages in the wild. Courtship appears to be mutually initiated,  with often revolving around the exchange of gifts,  typically consisting of objects with heavy "death auras" such as weapons or remains. Other practices recorded include displays of prowess with paranormal phenomena. These opening overtures are usually followed by a complex courtship dance,  which appears to incorporate heavy activity involving phasing through obstacles,  and through each other.
<p></p>It is unknown exactly how these creatures mate,  as they undergo the process of "obscura" much as other Pokemon when they mate,  which involves disappearing for prolonged periods of time before retuning with an egg or two. During this state,  all sign of the mating pair is lost barring the presence of strong electromagnetic radiation at the original site of vanishing. After this process ends,  the two will part ways,  though it appears that mating pairs of Dusclops and Dusknoir generally persist for several mating cycles before dissolution,  and some appear to persist indefinitely. Mating with members of other evolutionary lines in the wild is infrequent,  but not unheard of. When it does happen,  it is usually with other Ghost-types,  though mating with Pokémon such as Muk,  Gastrodon,  and Eelektross occasionally occurs,  but seldom more than once. Creatures from this group that do not normally undergo the process of "obscura" appear to often be rather disturbed by the process,  and are usually loath to repeat the experience.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Duskull line members are normally fairly solitary creatures. However,  they are generally not particularly territorial,  and will gladly congregate in fairly large groups for mating and in places where food is plentiful. Newly hatched Duskull generally receive little parental care beyond a month or so of loose supervision and tutoring of basic techniques such as phasing by their mothers,  their physical resilience and lack of natural predators serves to ensure that most Duskull will live for vastly longer than the typical Pokémon raised with a similar lack of parental care. It should be noted that loose grouping patterns are occasionally documented amongst these creatures,  which appears to coincide with incidences of "chain possession". It should be noted that Duskull that serve as host to other Duskull appear to display elevated strength and offensive abilities. As of present,  the most complex chain possession on record is known to have incorporated roughly 200 Duskull in the remains of an abandoned steeple.
<p></p>Interestingly,  these Pokémon appear to be capable of abruptly appearing in areas en masse,  exhibiting behaviors that appear to be consistent with those exhibited by migratory creatures. Initial attempts to track these movements have suggested that these seemingly migratory behaviors may be interdimensional in nature,  as a group of creatures from this line tracked from Hoenn Route 121 was once documented to have abruptly surfaced and remained deep within the confines of Wellspring Cave for almost a year,  a location that is said in myth to be a portal to a realm of the dead. This phenomenon is still being studied,  however,  and the exact destinations of these migrations is unknown.
<p></p><h2> In Human Culture</h2>
<p></p>In most cultures that have had extensive contact with Duskull and its brethren,  these creatures are widely feared and often loathed as malevolent spirits due to an association with death and the reaping of souls. They are the inspiration from countless death spirit and psychopomp characters,  and images of this line are plentiful on various holidays across the globe. In a handful of cultures,  these Pokémon see a more positive role in local folklore as guardians of soon-to-be departed spirits on their journey to the afterlife.
<p></p>Historically in human cultures,  Duskull's applications have generally been of an offensive nature. In general society,  they were sometimes utilized as guardians over shrines and grave sites,  and in less common circumstances as protectors of businesses and dwellings in communities with strong ghost-training traditions. In military applications,  such creatures often saw use alongside other Ghost Pokémon for purposes of infiltrating enemy fortifications,  and were favored in some circles for their often demoralizing effect upon enemies. In a handful of communities,  more practical applications of this lines feeding habits were developed,  namely the use of Duskull and Dusclops to absorb the fears of locals about to undertake stressful or dangerous tasks. In such communities,  these practices often have continued into the present day,  which occasionally manifests in these creatures' use in hospitals and Pokémon centers to absorb patient anxiety.
<p></p>Duskull and its brethren see numerous direct and indirect depictions in popular culture,  ranging from serious,  including as antagonistic psychopomps and forces of death,  one particularly common practice is to use a Duskull's faceplate as a sinister motif,  which forms the basis for the <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scream' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scream'>mask of a knife killer in a now moribund series of slasher films</a> <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDestination' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDestination'>as well as repeatedly in the promotional materials of a film series revolving around persons surviving tragic accidents via premonitions being steadily killed off in gruesome accidents</a>. More lighthearted depictions of Duskull line members and motifs associated with them also appear in media,  including as gag characters in sitcoms. One example from a work marketed directly towards children is <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy'>a Dusknoir who is forced to be best friends with two human children.</a> Duskull's influence on fashion can be seen in the abundance of clothing articles that depict Duskull's faceplate and red eye,  a motif that itself is fairly represented in popular culture with characters associated with juvenile delinquency,  some example appearances include on the shirts of a <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons'>local hoodlum and schoolyard bully in a long-running sitcom</a> and of <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToyStory' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToyStory'>a bratty,  destructive neighbor child in an animated film revolving around toys that become animate in their owner's absence</a>,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldEndsWithYou' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldEndsWithYou'>as well as on the beanie of a partner character in a role playing game set in an alternate Celadon shopping district published by the owners of the Last Legend and Dragonite Quest franchises.</a>

</div>Here's my Venipede line article
<p></p>Venipede Line
<p></p><h2>Morphs [Oak Catalogue #]</h2>
<p></p>Venipede [543]  Scolopendra venis
<p></p>Whirlipede [544] - Scolopendra whirlus
<p></p>Scolipede [545] - Scolopendra gigas
<p></p><h2>Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Venipede line are a trio of Chilopodan dual Bug and Poison type Pokémon.
<p></p>Venipede is a small Centipede standing between 20 and 60cm in height and weighing between 4 and 6kg. The chitinous exoskeleton on its upper body is magenta in colour with a large hump on its back and a black ring marking on each shoulder and around its neck. Its lower body is green in colouration and clearly segmented and its tail section is once again magenta in colour. The entirety of Venipedes underbelly is black as are its eight short stubby legs. Venipedes head is distinct from its body and possesses two lidded eyes with yellow sclera and a small beak-like nose and upper lip. Its head possesses two long magenta antennae with a thick black band around them about half way up their length which it uses to help it sense its surroundings. On its tail section it possesses two magenta coloured tails with black bands identical in shape to its antennae,  these tails can be used like antennae to assess their surroundings but are also tipped with a sharp sting through which Venipede can deliver a potent venom.
<p></p>Whirlipede is the second evolutionary stage and is vastly different in appearance to its previous stage. Whirlipede is now between 1 and 1.4m in height and can weigh between 50 and 80kg. Whirlipedes body is now curled into a round wheel-like shape from which it cant uncurl. Its segmented body is now a greyish purple in colour with a magenta ring in the centre of each segment and the sides of each segment are black forming a black ring on each side of Whirlipedes body surrounding the opening within which rests Whirlipedes eyes. Each of the segments of Whirlipedes body possesses a pair of small fin-like spines near where the segment curves around to the side. On two of the segments referred to as the head segment and the tail segment these spines are replaced a pair of antennae and singer-tipped tails respectively both of which have two black bands along their lengths with the segments only being able to be told apart by the length of the body part with the antennae being slightly longer than the tails.
<p></p>The third and final member of this line; Scolipede is far more recognisable as being related to Venipede than Whirlipede. Scolipede stands at between 2.4 and 2.7m tall making it the largest Bug-type Pokémon known and over 50cm taller than the second tallest Yanmega. Scolipede can weigh between 180 and 240kg making them by far the heaviest Bug-type Pokémon at close to double the next heaviest of its type,  Forretress,  as well as being one of the heaviest known Pokémon. Scolipedes segmented body is magenta in colour on top and black on its underside with each of the segments possessing a purple ring on either side. Scolipedes upper body is held up tall making Scolipede resemble classic depictions of centaurs. Scolipede stands on four magenta coloured legs with a black band around the knee of each leg and each leg ending in a black point. The four upper segments of Scolipedes body each possess a pair of short purple forelegs that are capable of injecting venom as well as possessing a pair in the segment between its hind legs. Scolipede possess a pair of magenta horns with three purple bands along their length on its head that can also be used as a set of antennae. Its tail segment also possesses a pair of stinger-tipped tails identical in shape and colour to its antennae.
<p></p><h2>Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Venipede line all possess a venom sac within their bodies that feed incredibly potent venom to their fangs,  tail stingers and spines or forelegs in Whirlipede and Scolipede respectively. This allows the members of the line to use powerful poison type attacks such as Toxic and Poison Tail.
<p></p>Scolipede have sufficient size and strength to create small earthquakes and to create small craters during battle though it needs coaching through a TM to learn these moves. Scolipede is also capable of learning the powerful Megahorn attack,  one of only 15 species capable of doing so. The three members of this line are also three of the only species of Pokémon able to learn the move Steamroller and it was originally thought to be unique to this line until a Golem belonging to a researcher visiting a Unovan research facility was seen copying the move after witnessing a Whirlipede being studied at the facility use the move.
<p></p>Also of note is Whirlipedes lack of visible mouth,  a subject that was one of the first to be investigated by Pokémon anatomists who discovered that Whirlepede are capable of opening the gap between the head segment and the segment below allowing it to obtain sustenance.
<p></p>There are three distinct sub-groups of these Pokémon each showing distinct traits. The first sub-group are covered in small venom coated hairs that can easily rub off when an opponent makes contact with members of this sub-group. These hairs can easily end up digging their way into the skin and poisoning the opponent. Members of this sub-group possess what is known as the Poison Point ability. The second sub-group possess the Swarm ability. The members of this sub-group have a heightened fight response in stressful situations causing them to produce large quantities of adrenaline which leads to an increase in the strength of their Bug-type moves. The third and rarest sub-group possess the Quick Feet ability. The members of this sub-group possess a bizarre immune response to ailments such as burns or poisons that allows them to send more energy to their limbs so as to move faster,  this means they also dont experience the same drop in speed while paralysed that most Pokémon do.
<p></p>As with all Pokémon there are members who possess a rare phenotype that alters their colouring. As Venipede these members are brown in colour where they are normally magenta and their lower body is a lighter green. As a Whirlepede these members are a much darker purple,  possess red sclera instead of yellow and green rings on their segments. Scolipedes with this phenotype have a much brighter red body,  light green sclera and aqua coloured rings and forelegs.
<p></p><h2>Habitat</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Venipede line make their home in large,  thick forests with Pinwheel and Lostlorn forests being their favourites. Venipede mostly live in bushes and thick undergrowth or in underground nests while Whirlipede spend most of their time in the thick undergrowth around the bases of large trees only moving to defend itself. Scolipede is a rare sight in the wild due to them living in the deepest and most difficult to reach areas of the forest.
<p></p>Members of these species are unlikely to be encountered outside of the Unova region without the assistance of a Pokémon Professor or professional Pokémon Ranger being employed though a small number of Venipede are believed to live in the deepest parts of both Ilex and Viridian forests and a team of researchers are trying to find a way to access these areas to confirm their existence.
<p></p><h2>Diet</h2>
<p></p>Venipede are carnivorous Pokémon and will feed on any rodent or insect smaller than itself after first poisoning it with the venom from its tails or fangs. Whirlepede will likewise feed on any rodent,  insect or bird smaller than itself; however where Venipede will actively hunt its prey Whirlipede will only attack those who come near. This combined with Whirlipedes mostly sedentary lifestyle mean that Whirlipede have an incredibly low metabolic rate comparable to that of pupae Pokémon such as Metapod and Kakuna. Scolipede will actively and aggressively hunt down their prey which consists of any bird,  rodent,  insect or amphibian smaller than itself with one deceased specimen being found with a partially digested Seismitoad in its stomach.
<p></p>As with all species of Pokémon the members of this line are perfectly happy to consume berries and commercial Pokémon food.
<p></p><h2>Hazards</h2>
<p></p>The most obvious hazard when dealing with the members of this line is their potent venom which in the Venipede and Whirlipede stages in unlikely to kill can easily an adult to be bedridden for a number of days as well as causing swelling,  chills,  fever and weakness and can be fatal to small children and those with allergies to bee stings to the point where it can cause them to go into anaphylactic shock. As a Scolipede this venom is much more potent and can be fatal to small children within a few hours or in less than one hour in the case of those allergic to stings. Even a full grown adult is at risk of death or severe health complications if they do not receive treatment within a few hours. Because of these hazards it is recommended that trainers passing through areas known to be home to any of the members of this line do so in the company of any Steel-type Pokémon whose typing makes them immune to the poison of these three Pokémon. Should a steel type Pokémon be unavailable then a powerful Fire or Flying-type Pokémon is recommended due to their advantageous type matchup with Pokémon of the Bug-type.
<p></p>Whirlipede are capable of spinning their bodies at very high speeds and thus are capable of dealing a great deal of damage to anyone that gets in their way,  it is therefore recommended to keep away from any Whirlepede that is unfamiliar with you as they are more than willing to defend themselves by rolling at high speeds at those it considers a threat.
<p></p>Due to their significant size and weight Scolipede are extremely dangerous to even grown adults and reports of people being trampled by an aggravated Scolipede are not uncommon.
<p></p>Due to the fine hairs that cover the body of members with the 'Poison Point' ability and their ability to poison even humans it is important to check if an individual has this ability before touching it and if so to wear thick gloves.
<p></p>Caution is highly recommended when dealing with wild or unfamiliar individuals of this line due to the fact all three members of the line are highly aggressive with Scolipede being considered one of the most aggressive Pokémon there is.
<p></p>As with any Poison-type Pokémon the members of this line are not recommended for young,  inexperienced trainers.
<p></p><h2>Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>The members of this line are largely solitary creatures though it is not uncommon for large numbers of Venipede to congregate together in underground nests. Whirlipede will only congregate together through coincidence of lying under the same tree. Scolipede are completely solitary and will fiercely defend their territory and only coming together in order to mate.
<p></p><h2>Courting</h2>
<p></p>While all morphs are capable of breeding only Scolipede will do so in the wild.
<p></p>During the late winter months the males will wonder their forest homes searching for females. When they discover a female they will deposit a spermatophore before continuing their search. The female will then take up this spermatophore in its entirety before waiting for other males to approach. Once breeding has occurred the female will lay her eggs during the spring and summer months. The females will lay between 15 and 60 eggs and will use her body to protect the eggs from various fungi and predators though she may abandon them if she is disturbed by a foe she cannot defeat.
<p></p>In captivity the members of the Venipede line will breed in a more traditional sense by a female pressing her ovipore to the respective male organ or a male ejecting his spermatophore into the female organ. Due to the protected environment of captive breeding females will lay only a single hard- shelled egg.
<p></p>Trainers should also note that if they are intending on breeding their Scolipede they are required by law,  due to their extreme size and weight size,  to do so only with Gliscor,  Yanmega,  Volcarona and other larger bug group Pokémon that are larger than 1.5m tall and that heavy fines and possibly jail sentences apply to trainers and day-care centres that allow a Scolipede to breed with Pokémon that are any smaller.
<p></p><h2>In Human Society</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Venipede line are uncommon in media with most of them being of Scolipede. Scolipede is mentioned in the titles of <a class='createlink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHumanCentepede' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHumanCentepede'>a pair of horror films</a><a class='createlink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHumanCentepedellTheFullSequence' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHumanCentepedellTheFullSequence'>involving humans being sewed together by insane men</a>.

<p></p>As usual comments and criticisms welcome.
<p></p>Also if no one has any more to say about it i'll put the Karrablast article on the wiki.

</div>Once again,  I don't like referring to abilities by name. You even split the name and actual descriptions into separate parts,  so you could fix that fairly easily. If you wanted to.

</div>The general consensus is that Pokémon form a different,  third route of evolution seperate from plants and animals,  correct? May I be presumptuous and suggest Sinumonstrum (badly-researched Latin for 'pocket monster') as the 'scientific' name of the kingdom?
<p></p>And by the way,  did you know Lotad was at least partially based on the tardigrade/water bear?

</div>Explaining how many Pokemon can interbreed but the offspring is based on the female could be done by describing Pokemon as having a very similar - but very large - genome.  Essentially the development would be pretty much entirely controlled by maternal effect genes,  causing anything from the father (if they're of different species) to be permanently silenced while activating what needs to not be silenced.  It's been a while since genetics so I forget exactly how they work.
<p></p>A different kingdom could work if you can use it to explain how so many vastly phenotypically different species can interbreed with each other.  Otherwise there doesn't necessarily need to be one.
