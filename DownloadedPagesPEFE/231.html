<p></p><div class="wmglead" ><strong>Buizel Line</strong></div>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Buizel [418]
</li><li> Floatzel [419]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>The <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons'>Pokémon</a> of the Buizel line are lutrine bipeds that share an orange-and-cream color scheme,  ridge-like growths covered by blue scales extending from the sides of their arms,  twin tails,  crested heads,  small ears obscured by their pelts,  and yellow air sacs used aid buoyancy.
<p></p>A typical Buizel stands 70 centimeters from foot to the tip of its crest at the back of its head and weighs just under 30 kilograms. Buizel are characterized by an orange pelt,  with cream regions covering its underbelly,  muzzle,  its paw pads,  two regions above its eyes resembling eyebrows,  the tips of its tails,  and one or two dots along its back depending upon the individual's gender. Although they have no apparent claws,  careful inspection of a Buizel's digits will reveal small but sharp claws which enable it to both better grip food as well as surfaces in order to exit bodies of water. A Buizel's yellow buoyancy sac rings its neck,  giving a collar-like appearance.
<p></p>Average individuals from Buizel's final stage,  Floatzel,  stand roughly 110 centimeters in height and typically weigh a scant 4 kilograms more than their younger and less lithe brethren. Floatzel pelts are similarly colored to those of their younger counterparts,  and have cream regions covering the entirety of their underbellies barring a teardrop-shaped patch of orange fur on the front of their lower abdominal regions,  the entirety of their forepaws and forearms,  their muzzles,  tail tips,  one or two moderately-sized elliptical dots on their backs,  and a small circular patch on their foreheads. Floatzel have more defined proportionately larger head crests than their younger brethren,  more prominent claws,  and have a buoyancy sac that rings the entirety of their torsos and abdomen,  with an appearance not wholly unlike that of a yellow inflatable dinghy. Floatzel also possess proportionately narrower and longer scaled ridges on their arms than Buizel,  which have an appearance not wholly unlike that of two large,  dulled spikes.
<p></p>In rare circumstances,  members of the Buizel line with yellow and white pelts and white buoyancy sacs have been recorded,  and are prized among collectors.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>One of the defining features of members of the Buizel line is the presence of inflatable air sacs that act as buoyancy aids. These sacs are extensions of the respiratory systems of members of this line,  not wholly unlike the internal air sacs of many avian Pokémon. These air sacs are protected by relatively thick and durable tissue layers and are separated from the rest of a Buizel/Floatzel's respiratory system via a series of folds of connective tissue that prevent a Buizel/Floatzel's lungs from becoming flooded by water in the event of a ruptured air sac. In addition to greater buoyancy,  these air sacs also enable members of the Buizel line to remain underwater for extended periods of time. It is not uncommon for members of the Buizel line to perforate their air sacs at some point during their lives. Individuals with such injuries typically adopt a temporarily terrestrial lifestyle until the puncture wound(s) in their air sacs have fully healed.
<p></p>Another defining feature of these lutrine creatures is their unique double tails,  which Buizel and Floatzel manipulate by forming corkscrew motions in water to propel themselves. These motions are very rapid,  and are forceful enough to allow members of this line to slice through lesser obstacles in bodies of water such as mats of seaweed with ease,  as well as to fire bursts of air as a means of attack through techniques such as SonicBoom and Razor Wind. Members of the Buizel line with injured tails can easily be spotted by their slow,  awkward movements in the water. A popular,  though widely disparaged,  practice among some Buizel trainers is to encourage their Pokémon to rotate their tails fast enough to allow for short airborne hops. Although amusing,  this trick is both a safety hazard and puts the performing Buizel at risk of straining the muscles that it uses to manipulate its tails.
<p></p>On occasional circumstances,  individuals belonging to a rare submorph of these creatures have been recorded. Individuals from this submorph appear to move dramatically slower in bodies of water than their more common counterparts,  but at the same time,  appear to display mild regenerative properties when exposed to sources of water for extended periods.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Despite their classification as "Sea Weasel" Pokémon,  Buizel and Floatzel can be found in a truly astonishing variety of both marine and freshwater aquatic habitats. Known saltwater habitats include both rocky and sandy coastal areas and estuaries,  and freshwater habitats are known to include swift-moving rivers and environments with stiller water such as swamps. Most peculiarly,  it appears that creatures from this line are capable of living within truly bizarre aquatic environments,  as stable populations of Buizel and Floatzel have been documented in isolated lake systems in caves and mountainous regions,  most notably in the vicinity of Sinnoh's Victory Road. Individuals living in marine environments are known to exhibit migratory behaviors,  with Pokémon from this line having been documented in transit between coastal sites in Sinnoh and sites in Johto and Kanto.
<p></p>Members of the Buizel line are most commonly encountered in Sinnoh,  with populations in western Sinnoh generally trending towards freshwater environments,  while populations in eastern Sinnoh generally trend towards marine or otherwise brackish environments. Small but stable populations of Buizel and Floatzel have been recorded throughout Kanto and Johto,  with most populations located in freshwater environments,  with exceptions including populations of these creatures along the coastline in the regions around Routes 26,  27,  and 47. Stable populations of these Pokémon have presently been documented in two regions in Unova,  in the regions surrounding Unova Routes 11 and 14.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Members of the Buizel line are noted for their fast metabolisms,  and healthy individuals have been noted to consume in excess of 15% of their body masses in food on a daily basis. While Buizel and Floatzel appear to be capable of subsisting on an omnivorous diet like a majority of <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons'>Pokémon</a>,  wild individuals appear to have a heavy slant towards a carnivorous diet comprised mostly of fish-like,  mollusk-like,  and crustacean-like prey. Both morphs appear to consume plant matter on a fairly regular basis,  and appear to have an affinity for the Wacan Berry. In circumstances where both normal prey and edible plant matter is scarce,  it is not unheard of for Buizel and Floatzel to hunt other aquatic creatures for sustenance.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>While Buizel and Floatzel's reputation for being playful and amiable and their perception as being creatures suitable for beginning trainers is not wholly undeserved,  they are by no means creatures to take lightly. Like any Pokémon,  Buizel and Floatzel are usually most hazardous when they are irritated or frightened. Members of this line have been known to lash out at perceived threats or aggressors through a wide variety of methods. Both members of this line employ a range of tackle attacks,  including several that incorporate feigned retreats in order to catch opponents off guard. Tackles from a Buizel are more than enough to knock adult humans off their feet and can leave deep bruises as well as lacerations and scrapes from their claws,  tackles from the aforementioned mustelid's elder morph have been known to break bones,  cause internal bleeding,  and leave gashes deep enough to necessitate medical sutures. Buizel and Floatzel are also known to utilize attacks that involve creating bursts of air with suspended debris with their tails as a means of attack,  which are capable of causing lacerations on exposed skin.
<p></p>Both morphs in this line are also known to attack by expelling pressurized jets of water out of their mouths. Although painful,  these attacks are arguably among the least hazardous attacks employed by members of this line,  though it should be noted that humans attacked by these jets of water have been known to suffer bruising,  and in some instances involving attacks by Floatzel,  loss of exposed patches of skin. Among captive Buizel and Floatzel,  a there is a commonly taught battle technique that involves attacking opponents with jets of unusually salty water. Although this attack presents no greater danger on its own in comparison to the naturally learned attacks in this vein,  it is typically employed on opponents with visible wounds,  an experience which has been noted to be vastly more painful for the unlucky party on the receiving end. Both creatures in this line have been known to employ biting attacks,  especially Floatzel. Buizel bites are seldom serious,  and usually employed as a desperation attack,  though they will easily leave puncture wounds and carry a risk of bacterial infection. Floatzel bites are far more dangerous,  as the mustelid's unassuming jaws are more than capable of severing digits and fracturing bones. Irritated and frightened Pokémon in this line also pose risks toward imprudent trainers on bodies of water,  as both Buizel and Floatzel have been known to attack foes in marine environments by creating localized whirlpools capable of capsizing small boats.
<p></p>There are also a number of more mundane hazards that members of this line pose towards trainers,  which can quickly turn an affectionate romp into a trip to the emergency room. The most prominent of these lesser hazards are the twin tails that members of this line possess. Both Buizel and Floatzel employ their tails as a means of propulsion in their native environment,  using their muscles to manipulate them into moving in a screw-like fashion not unlike the motion of a propeller,  a practice that manifests itself by habit when these creatures are on dry land. Although this practice is seen by many trainers as endearing,  it is also capable of inflicting bruises,  lacerations,  and in more extreme cases hairline fractures and dislocated limbs upon a trainer foolhardy enough to stick a bodily appendage near a Buizel's or Floatzel's moving tails. Both Buizel and Floatzel are known to generally be very energetic and playful,  which can lead to problems among individuals that have a poor grasp of their own strength. Poorly trained Buizel and Floatzel have sent many an inexperienced trainer to the hospital through well-intentioned but excessive roughhousing or overly playful nips and scratches. Reports of Floatzel accidentally drowning or nearly drowning their trainers while cavorting in bodies of water are not unheard of. Due to their popularity among novice trainers,  a number of communities near large bodies of water with a large Buizel or Floatzel population maintain public awareness campaigns focusing on safely raising and encountering these creatures.
<p></p><h2> Courting</h2>
<p></p>Both Buizel and Floatzel are capable of reproduction,  though reproduction among Buizel is uncommon outside of captivity. Courtship is usually initiated by male suitors,  which will attempt to impress a potential mate through a variety of observed methods including what appear to be marine "acrobatics" and the offering of gifts of food and other objects. Courtship behaviors appear to vary with habitat,  one of the most pronounced of these variations is that of the courtship rituals of creatures from this line in subterranean environments,  which appear to revolve almost entirely around gifts of food and light-reflecting objects. It is not uncommon for a single female to receive advances from multiple males,  which often leads to heated battles among prospective suitors. Buizel and Floatzel have also been recorded courting and being courted by individuals outside of their immediate line,  though these interactions are fairly rare outside of captivity. After selecting an appealing suitor,  a female member of the Buizel line will mate with her chosen male,  usually in bodies of water,  and typically remains with the male until her offspring are capable of fending for themselves. It is not unheard of for a single breeding pair of members of the Buizel line to remain together for the duration of their lives,  though this practice appears to be more common in captivity than in the wild.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Both Buizel and Floatzel exhibit a biological quirk that enables their eggs to survive reproduction through both ovoviviparous and oviparous methods. The former reproductive method is most commonly seen among Floatzel,  and typically occurs in the event of the birth of single offspring. The latter method is seen most commonly in the event of the birth of multiple offspring,  and curiously,  appears to occur in an overwhelming majority of observed captive births.
<p></p>Buizel are born blind,  Buizel among more terrestrial populations typically in a holt either dug into the ground or fashioned from a sufficiently large hollow log,  and Buizel among less terrestrial popultions are often born in shallow water. Newly born Buizel are wholly dependent upon their parents and any older siblings for protection and sustenance during the first weeks of their lives. In addition,  Buizel and Floatzel organize themselves into rafts consisting of anywhere from 6 to over 150 individuals,  which act as an additional supportive structure for the offspring of members of a raft. Rafts also serve a fundamentally protective structure for their members,  which manifests itself in numerous forms,  including the practice of rafts of Buizel and Floatzel dozing in bodies of water clasping hands in order to avoid being sent adrift. During their first 2 months alive,  Buizel develop their swimming capabilities through observation and emulation of its parents and siblings,  and begin to receive their first hunting lessons from members of their immediate family as well as incorporation into the social structures of the broader raft. Buizel are typically sheltered by their parents for the first 12 months of their lives,  after which they are left to take care of themselves as members of their raft.
<p></p>Rafts appear to exhibit fairly loose social ties,  and fluctuate in size due to members leaving due to internal squabbles or to start their own rafts. As Buizel age and draw near their evolution into Floatzel,  they will typically join progressively smaller rafts due to increased competition for food.
<p></p><h2> In Human Society</h2>
<p></p>Both members of the Buizel line are renowned for their generally genial and playful temperaments,  and are one of a small number of Pokémon are considered (relatively) safe to be in close proximity to in the wild. Floatzel have also been recorded rescuing drowning humans and other creatures in bodies of water,  which makes the creatures a staple among lifeguards. Among fishermen,  Buizel and Floatzel are seen as both a blessing and a curse,  as wild individuals have been known to steal catches and damage valuable fishing equipment,  but captive individuals are prized among hobbyist fishermen for their assistance in herding catches into nets and near lures. Buizel and Floatzel were once prized for their pelts among fur traders,  though the proliferation of media,  particularly works directed towards children,  revolving around Buizel and Floatzel and a corresponding surge in popularity has all but annihilated the trade. Buizel and Floatzel remain fixtures of modern media,  and occupy prominent roles in a truly staggering number of movie,  television,  literary,  and video game franchises,  including as <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarryPotter'>the form of the protective spirit of a major character in a series of books following youths at a wizarding school</a>,  and as the creators of an advanced precursor civilization in a popularly received platforming series.

</div>Okay,  since I feel it's about time I tell you guys this...
<p></p>I'm dropping out of this project now. There might be a slim chance I'll get back into it at some point in the future,  but I don't really see that happening until next year or something. So I've taken the liberty of deleting my section of the Dibs page and am letting you guys know that you are free to take over the Scraggy and Reshiram articles that I had called before.
<p></p>I don't know how to conclude this... I guess all I can really say is goodbye. I think I've put it off long enough that I should say it now or never say it at all. And I'd rather say it now. So...
<p></p>Bye guys. Have fun with the project! I know I had tons of fun with it.

<p></p>Man,  that was lame.
<p></p><h1> Roggenrola Line</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalogue #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Roggenrola [524]
</li><li> Boldore [525]
</li><li> Gigalith [526]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Notable Bio</h2>
<p></p>Hailing mainly from the Unova region,  the unusual looking Roggenrola line takes a role <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy'>very similar</a> to the Geodude line in the Kanto,  Johto,  Hoenn,  and Sinnoh regions. Roggenrola are a relatively new Pokemon to Unova,  and the surface world in general,  having only appeared in the last 100 years above the surface due to a fissure in the area that would later be known as Wellspring Cave. The first morph,  Roggenrola,  is a small Pokemon slightly over a foot in height that is circular in shape and brown and blue in coloration,  with a <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyelessFace' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyelessFace'>yellow section on the center surrounding a hexagonal ear</a>,  and a rocky crest on top of their heads. Their unusual features are due to the fact that their original habitat is deep under the earth,  leading to their nickname of "The Mantle Pokémon".
<p></p>Since they originally lived in a completely subterranean habitat,  Roggenrola are completely blind,  and as a result they use a form of echolocation to find their way around by sending out sonic pulses using their ears. These pulses reproduce their surroundings completely to the Pokémon,  and are more or less as good at sight,  with variation between individual Roggenrola. They can also use low frequency sounds to communicate amongst each other.
<p></p>Roggenrola are powered by an metallic inner core,  which is protected by one of the thickest cuticles out of any Pokémon. Simply put,  due to their original environment being fairly pressurized,  the outer skin of a Roggenrola is as thick as iron,  and hard enough that the Pokémon cannot be knocked out by a single blow,  making it capable of withstanding a direct horn jab by a non-blunted Nidoking horn completely unscathed. A Roggenrolas shell will only increase in durability as the Pokémon evolves.
<p></p>As for the core itself,  it is located in the center of the Roggenrola in a holding container filled with a conductive fluid similar to battery acid in acidity. The core is also mildly radioactive,  and its energy is transported throughout the Pokémons body through a system of canals similar to the organic circulatory system filled with a conducting fluid of much lower acidity. At this stage,  the low energy requirements of Roggenrola means that the core is pretty much self-sustaining. However,  as the Pokémon gets older,  the core has to work harder to power it. If it doesn't evolve in time,  however,  the Roggenrola will enter a state of torpor to conserve energy and eventually "reboot" itself. One way this torpor state can be hastened is through the use of cold temperatures,  similar to the old trick of putting batteries in a refrigerator,  though the majority of Roggenrola end up starving when their cores finally stop working.
<p></p>Once a Roggenrola reaches a certain energy threshold,  it will evolve into a Boldore. Standing at just under three feet tall,  Boldore have a more elongated body than Roggenrola,  with two ears,  three legs,  and a body covered in crystals created by energy from the core leaking out and solidifying in the open air.
<p></p>Boldore live at even deeper depths than Roggenrola,  and their new crystals often glow when their inner core overflows with energy. As a result,  they can fire off this energy at assailants in the form of blasts of light; similar to how the <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Vanillite' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Vanillite'>Vanillite Line</a> can use their bodies as lenses to fire beams of light. Boldore mainly spend their lives looking for mineral water deep underground,  which is why compared to other Rock type Pokemon they have a lesser fear of water.  However,  significantly large bodies of water such as the ocean will cause a similar reaction to just about every other Rock and/or Ground type Pokémon.
<p></p>The final form,  Gigalith,  is an incredibly rare sight in the wild. Wild Boldore have to be put under high heat and pressure deep underground to undergo the evolutionary process,  which can take decades to complete. For this reason,  the vast majority of Trainers prefer to use the electromagnetic signals created by trading machines to facilitate evolution in their Pokémon.
<p></p>Gigalith stand five inches less than six feet,  with a quadrupedal body,  longer,  sharper crystals than a Boldore,  and a distinct head with well developed eyes and a mouth,  the former being a rather strange trait for a primarily subterranean creature. Gigalith crystals have a different lattice structure to that of a Boldores,  allowing them to absorb as well as fire off energy. When solar energy is absorbed by Gigalith crystals,  the Pokemon is capable of magnifying the solar energy gathered in order to fire off devastating blasts of solar radiation from its mouth. At least one Gigalith is recorded as being able to blow away an entire cliffside with the sheer power of its Solarbeam.
<p></p>There exist Roggenrola that are purple in color unlike their blue brethren,  and evolve into Boldore and Gigalith with blue crystals instead of red,  due to a slight chemical difference in core composition. These rare Pokémon are greatly prized by collectors. Rarer still are a subspecies of Roggenrola that have thinner outer casings,  but are capable of using sediment to fire larger,  thicker rocks from their bodies.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
Roggenrola and its evolutions are naturally found deep underneath the earth,  with the majority of the population being located at a depth impossible to reach at the time of this article. As for the Wellspring group,  after reaching the surface they quickly established themselves within all of Unovas caverns through their tunneling system.
<p></p>Roggenrola tend to live inside their birth caves (See Courting and Childrearing) until they evolve,  at which point they use underground tunnels created by Boldore and the occasional Gigalith to find a new cave to live in. These caves tend to have large supplies of water.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Roggenrola survive mainly on their cores,  and as a result do not eat anything. Boldore and Gigalith on the other hand drink mineral water and eat ores,  similar to the <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Aron' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Aron'>Aron Line's</a> dietary habits,  in order to feed their far more high-maintenance cores. In captivity,  Boldore and Gigalith can also be fed berries. The former can absorb them using its bottommost crystals,  whereas the latter can just eat them like most other Pokémon.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Though Roggenrola and its evolutions are rather easy-going Pokémon,  it would not be a good idea to antagonize them. The rocky bodies of the Roggenrola line make most attacks ineffective against them,  forcing Trainers to go into prolonged battles with them unless they have Pokemon capable of defeating Roggenrolas defensive shell.
Roggenrola may be small and slow,  but theyre also very powerful for their size. If they cannot waddle away from a threat,  or harden to the point that it gives up,  they will fight against it using bone-breaking headbutts,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingToCatchMeFightingDirty' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryingToCatchMeFightingDirty'>kicking sand or mud in its eyes</a>,  or firing rocks from their ear hole at an assailants head and/or chest with deadly precision.
<p></p>Boldore and Gigalith can do everything Roggenrola can,  but <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSameButMore' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSameButMore'>better</a>,  and up their arsenal through causing rock slides,  blasting out sediment to create sandstorms,  firing pointed stone shards at opponents,  firing beams of light from their crystals,  and firing rocks with such accuracy that they can knock flying or floating Pokémon right out of the air. As a last resort,  they can overclock their cores so that everything around them is caught up in a catastrophic explosion. Apart from being temporarily knocked out,  they will be left more or less unharmed,  unlike their assailants,  which may be left <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs'>in pieces.</a>  The area around them may also turn into a small crater from the energy exerted in the blast.
<p></p>In the case of Gigalith,  they can also use their solar radiation blasts or simply crush an enemy under their weight,  if theyre close enough. Also,  their crystals can leave pretty nasty wounds if youre careless while handling them. Luckily,  their lack of speed means that simply running away is enough to cause them to leave you alone.
<p></p>On the rare occasion that something breaks through to the core,  it is immediately met by the acidic conducting fluid well,  as well as mild radiation. While short-term exposure is harmless,  long-term exposure can lead to health complications later on in life. [[Trainers Note: Specialty stores sell lead casing for special cases such as this. They allow the Pokemon to rebuild its shell while protecting others from the radiation emanating from the Pokemon.]]
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>Though Roggenrola are capable of breeding shortly before evolution,  it is not often seen outside of captivity. When female Boldore and Gigalith are ready to mate,  they send out low frequency sounds in order to attract suitors. Once suitors show up,  they examine them for armor thickness and song quality before picking one to mate with.
<p></p>Once mating is completed,  the parents will use caverns to head over to a birthing cave,  such as Wellspring Cave,  to lay their eggs. The parents will guard them during the week it takes for them to hatch,  staying only to teach their children basic sound creation skills before leaving. The Roggenrola spend time inside their birth cave until they evolve into Boldore,  at which point they travel through caverns back to the cave where they were conceived. This is more a pathology of wild Roggenrola culture,  as captive members of this line have no problems making more lasting bonds with their children,  fellow teammates,  and Trainers.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Like <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Psyduck' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Psyduck'>Golduck</a>,  Roggenrola are Pokemon that are mainly solitary,  but have no problems interacting with others. In the wild,  they mainly spend time alone or in groups of two except when there happens to be a particularly large source of water that causes them to converge,  or when theyre mating or migrating.
<p></p><h2> In Popular Culture</h2>
<p></p>Due to the physical toughness of Roggenrola and its evolutions,  the Unovan version of a popular idiom is,  "between a Roggenrola and a hard place" to represent two equally tough choices. In recent times,  a terrorist cell attempted to use a group of Roggenrola to create a massive death ray powered by their Flash Cannon techniques,  but this attempt was thwarted due to the efforts of three young trainers and one lone Roggenrola,  whos identities remain unknown as of this writing.

<p></p>seeing as in game,  Sturdy leaves mons with 1 hp,  I wouldn't say completely unscathed is the correct choice of words here. :p "Intact" would probably be a better choice.
<p></p>also,  the whole thing about Roggenrola not evolving in time and dying. What determines that? They have no intake of anything,  so unless location innately makes a difference,  the only difference between those that do and don't make it would be genetic.

</div>Yeah,  it does.
<p></p>To explain,  a Roggenrola's inner core is for all intents and purposes the battery equivalent of a yolk sac. Eventually,  the reaction will stop working,  though it takes place over such a long period of time after missing the evolution threshold that it's not something that most trainers worry about.

<p></p>Spinarak Line
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li>Spinarak (#167)
<p></p></li><li>Ariados (#168)
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>Spinarak is a Bug-<a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousPerson'>Poison</a> Pokémon. It is half a meter long,  and weighs 8.5 kilograms. Its body is divided into two sections: head (actually a cephalothorax) and abdomen,  which are separated by a cylindrical joint. Spinaraks head is a pale green,  with two large compound eyes,  a small white horn (actually a spinneret) protruding from the center of its forehead,  and two stubby red chelicerae. Spinaraks mouth is on the underside of its head,  and cannot be seen on a casual glance. The head makes up about one third of Spinaraks body. Its abdomen is also green. A pair of legs is attached at the gap between head and abdomen,  and another two pairs extend backwards from Spinaraks cephalothorax,  giving them the appearance of being spaced throughout the abdomen. Spinaraks legs are yellow,  with a dark blue band around the joint,  and dozens of tiny hairs at the tip. Spinaraks abdomen contains pigments that form a blue,  face-like pattern on Spinaraks back,  which are used to startle would-be predators. These pigments will occasionally shift,  causing the face to change. Rumors that the face-spot reflects Spinaraks moods are unfounded and most likely false. Although novices to the Pokémon world occasionally have trouble figuring out whether Spinarak is facing towards or away from them,  an experienced Trainer should have no trouble. At the tip of Spinaraks abdomen are two small spinnerets,  which can produce a stream of webbing at command (Spinarak produce webbing at a very fast rate,  enabling them to fire jets of it as a defense).
<p></p>Ariados is much larger than Spinarak,  at 1.1 meters long and 33.5 kilograms. It is now primarily red,  with black pigments in its abdomen,  which has stretched,  becoming more egg-shaped than round. Ariadoss head has shrunk slightly in comparison to its body,  although it is still larger than Spinaraks. Ariadoss chelicerae are white,  and are longer and sharper than those of Spinarak. Its eyes are purple,  and its horn-spinneret has lengthened to almost fifteen centimeters. Ariadoss legs are far longer than as Spinarak,  at about 60 centimeters each. They are yellow,  with purple stripes at the joint and near the tip. Ariados now has only four legs,  as the last pair has moved onto its back,  becoming sharp <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareMyStingerTail' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareMyStingerTail'>stingers.</a> The spinneret at the tip of its tail has grown,  becoming an eight-centimeter yellow protrusion. Wild Ariados use this spinneret to leave a trail of web,  which will always lead back to its nest. (See Notable Biology for information)
<p></p>Both Spinarak and Ariados exhibit a mutation in which their colors change drastically. Spinarak with the mutant gene are primarily cyan,  with pink replacing the yellow on their legs and the red in their mandibles. Ariados with the gene are mostly pink,  with a light blue in place of their ordinary purple leg stripes and eyes. The sections of Ariadoss body that are normally yellow also become a much lighter shade. These variations are highly prized for their rarity.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>A Spinaraks web is incredibly strong,  capable of stopping a charging Tauros in its tracks. Ariadoss is even stronger,  and studies show that it is capable of immobilizing an 18-wheeler. The web also appears to have properties that interfere with electrical signals,  as it can prevent a Pokémon from being called back into its Pokeball. The Spinarak lines webbing also gives off faint pheromones,  and a Spinarak or Ariados can use balls or trails of web as tracking devices. They use this adaptation to find prey,  and leave a trail back to their nest. (See Diet). Spinarak and Ariados will both spin webs along the ground,  and will use them as tripwires to catch prey that wanders into their territory. The silk also contains various nutrients,  and if a web is broken,  the Spinarak or Ariados will eat it before making a new one.
<p></p>The Spinarak line has no muscles in its legs,  and although it can flex them at the base,  it can only extend its legs by boosting its own blood pressure. Consequently,  a member of the Spinarak line with an injured cephalothorax is incapable of extending its legs (crippling it severely),  and the legs of a dead Spinarak or Ariados will curl up. Ariados are capable of jumping incredible distances by rapidly increasing the blood pressure in its back legs in a sudden burst.
<p></p>The tiny hairs on the Spinarak lines legs serve two purposes. First,  they allow the members of the Spinarak line to crawl along vertical surfaces. Second,  and more importantly,  they are capable of sensing tiny vibrations,  such as the ones caused by a very small animal walking along a trip-web. After evolution,  the bristles only become stronger. They are sensitive enough to wake even a sleeping Ariados,  and are responsible for a rumor that Ariados do not sleep (completely false).
<p></p>Both Spinarak and Ariados are poisonous. While both Pokémon hold venom in their chelicerae,  Ariados also stores it in its two stingers. Ariados cannot manipulate its stingers,  so when it needs to attack with them,  it will <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu'>spin and jump wildly,  flailing its stingers at its foe and secreting venom randomly.</a> While this may seem pointless and haphazard,  it is frighteningly effective in battle (See Hazards).
<p></p>Due to their resemblance,  many people believe Spinarak to be related to the Unovan Pokémon Joltik. Scientists are currently looking into this,  and most people believe it to be the case. An additional factor that adds weight to this case is the ability of the Joltik line to spit webbing at targets,  an ability previously believed to belong only to the Spinarak line.
<p></p>The Spinarak line appears to have evolved certain latent <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers'>psychic ability.</a> Older Spinarak or Ariados are capable of harnessing this power to create a mental blast,  which they will use primarily to stun prey or predators. While members of the Spinarak line can learn how to control their psychic powers in the wild,  captivity-born members are usually much better at it. In addition to psychic attacks,  Spinarak are also capable of firing beams of obscura,  and augmenting their own shadow with obscura to strike at their foes from behind.
<p></p>Spinarak and Ariados exhibit three noted subtypes. The first has bristles far more developed and sensitive than other Spinarak or Ariados,  and the slightest vibration is enough to wake them from the deepest sleep. The second will exhibit a surprising boost in strength when injured or fatigued (scientists theorize that wild Ariados use this boost to quickly end a battle so that they can escape). The third,  which is far rarer than the other two,  has developed far better eyesight than the other two subtypes,  and is also capable of focusing for much longer. This enables them to study their opponent carefully,  and find any possible weak points. Coupled with the ability to charge energy for attacks far quicker than others of its species,  Spinarak or Ariados with this subtype can inflict far greater injury with carefully-placed attacks.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>The Spinarak line is native to Johto. Spinarak are found almost everywhere,  while Ariados are found only on a handful of routes. Both Pokémon are nocturnal,  and will hide in trees and burrows during the day. Ariados is also found on Route 229 in Sinnoh,  although Spinarak is not. Spinarak can be found in a small patch of forest north of Fortune Island called the Pattern Bush,  but there is not enough prey in the area to support populations of Ariados. Neither species is naturally found in Hoenn,  although they were recently introduced into the Safari Zone there.
<p></p>Spinarak and Ariados live in forests,  and make several different types of nests. While the majority of Ariados will make a large web in a tree,  and are thus not seen often by Trainers,  Spinarak are more commonly found in small burrows (although they are occasionally found in trees). The Sinnoh Ariados will also make burrows on occasion. Due to the variety of Spinarak and Ariadoss homes,  when walking in a forest known to be inhabited by members of the Spinarak line,  Trainers should always be prepared for the possibility of an appearance,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel'>no matter how safe the area looks.</a>
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Both Spinarak and Ariados are mostly carnivorous. After killing their prey,  they will inject it with digestive enzymes,  liquefying its innards,  and will then drink the result.
<p></p>Spinarak hunt primarily through ambush. They will climb a tree or dig a burrow,  waiting for a Pokémon (usually small Bug-types,  although Spinarak will happily eat birds or small mammals if given a chance). When an edible Pokémon passes by,  Spinarak will burst out of cover,  attempting to down the prey with webs and occasionally psychic assaults. Ground-dwelling Spinarak will use a trip-web to assist this process.
<p></p>Ariados also use these methods,  but they will add several steps to it. First,  most Ariados have a web (not a trip-web,  but an actual web built up between trees) reasonably near their burrow,  which will catch any Pokémon that are too hasty about running away,  leaving Ariados to eat them at leisure. Second,  should would-be prey actually manage to escape,  Ariados will attach a small ball of webbing to it. It will then <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit'>use the pheromones left by the web to track its escaped prey,  usually back to the preys nest,  where additional food is readily available.</a> Ariados will eat almost any Pokémon it can find (although it prefers Bug and Flying types),  and there are even reports of live Stantler being trapped in a web. Ariados is also one of the few Pokémon that will happily eat humans.
<p></p>On very rare occasions,  when prey is scarce,  both Spinarak and Ariados have been seen eating plants and drinking nectar.
<p></p>[Trainers Note: In captivity,  if you are uncomfortable with your Ariados eating meat,  they are perfectly capable of subsisting on a vegetarian diet of berries. However,  it is best that you occasionally serve your Ariados meat as a treat.]
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Spinarak are not particularly hostile or dangerous Pokémon. If you encounter one,  the odds are is that it is more scared of you,  and unless you intentionally disturb it,  the Spinarak in question will probably run away. However,  should you be attacked by a Spinarak (most likely only if it is starving),  do not release your Pokémon,  as it may see them as a snack. Just run away. It isnt likely to follow.
<p></p>Ariados,  however,  are undoubtedly dangerous Pokémon. While Spinaraks venom will cause severe swelling and irritation in larger animals,  a standard dose (the amount delivered in a bite) of Ariadoss is almost invariably fatal if not quickly treated. Should you or one of your Pokémon be injured by a wild Ariados,  seek medical attention immediately. In addition,  even the blow from an Ariadoss stinger can cause severe bruising and occasionally broken bones. Because of these dangers,  many people have petitioned for the banning of Ariados,  but the major leagues allow them
(There is,  however,  a condition,  that Ariados deliver only one-tenth of their standard doses,  which they are capable of doing. Trainers found using a full dose of venom will be fined severely) if the trainer has a license.
<p></p>[Trainers Note: Even if your Pokémon has only been poisoned by the league-accepted dose,  seek medical attention for Pokémon poisoned by an Ariados at your first opportunity.]
<p></p>[Trainers Note: Should you find yourself trapped in the web of either member of the Spinarak line,  do not panic. Struggling will only attract your captor,  and is unlikely to free you. Instead,  release as many Pokémon as you can reach,  and enlist their help in freeing you. Once youre out,  run as fast as you can before the Spinarak or Ariados to whom the web belongs sees you and starts spraying web at you.]
<p></p>Keep in mind that Ariados are not actually aggressive Pokémon. Should you come across one outside of its nest,  it is most likely following a different Pokémon,  and will not bother you unless provoked.
<p></p><h2> Courtship and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>Spinarak do not breed in the wild,  although they will do so in captivity.
<p></p>When an Ariados finds another Ariados,  it will check if the other one is of the opposite gender and if it is currently receptive to mating. If it is,  the male will begin an elaborate courtship dance. If the female finds the dance satisfactory,  she will mate with the male. Ariados lay several thousand eggs at a time,  and the female will bury them in the ground.
<p></p>Mating time is a ritual fraught with danger for the male. If at any point the female decides that he is unsatisfactory,  she will attack him. Even if all goes well,  the male will most likely be attacked as soon as the female is done with him. Consequently,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex'>few male Ariados survive mating</a> (In captivity,  Ariados can be trained out of this behavior,  although it takes dedication).
<p></p>Baby Spinarak are only a few millimeters long. After they are born,  their mother will carry the babies around until they have grown (during this period,  the baby Spinarak will eat each other until they have grown to full size; usually only three or four remain at this point). The Spinarak will then leave to find their own homes.
<p></p>Spinarak,  like many Bug Pokémon,  have a hard cuticle as opposed to skin. Because of this,  when Spinaraks soft inner body outgrows the cuticle,  it undergoes molting,  where the cuticle is discarded and Spinarak is allowed to grow before developing a new cuticle. Spinarak usually eat a lot in preparation for each molting,  as their body needs an extra boost of energy in order to grow.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Spinarak are fairly solitary Pokémon,  and are rarely found in groups larger than three or four. When Spinarak groups meet,  they will engage in contests of intimidation until one group backs down and leaves. These contests involve posturing,  rapid scuttles at opponents,  and a clicking sound that Spinarak produce by rapidly snapping their chelicerae. Spinarak groups will remain together until evolution.
<p></p>In sharp contrast to their pre-evolved state,  Ariados are usually solitary,  and will immediately drive out any Ariados (of the same gender,  they are likely to mate if of the opposite gender) found in their territory.
<p></p>Both members of the Spinarak line will occasionally form large swarms,  primarily to drive out invaders to an Ariados forest. These swarms have been known to swell up to dozens strong,  and anything that gets in the way of an Ariados swarm will find itself in grave danger.
<p></p><h2> In Human Society</h2>
<p></p>Although many people are scared of Spinarak,  it is generally respected in most communities. Spinarak silk is incredibly strong,  and Spinarak are often used in construction to help lift large blocks. A small town in Johto even uses Spinarak in place of the standard Growlithe to assist police officers in tracking down criminals. Some Spinarak are also trained to make decorative webs,  and can produce beautiful patterns for festive occasions.
<p></p>Ariados,  however,  is far less liked. Its habit of tracking prey back to its home and eating its family has led to the belief that Ariados never allows prey to escape,  and will <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator'>track it to the ends of the Earth if necessary.</a> While this is false (Ariados will follow prey for a long time,  but will most likely lose the trail after an hour or two),  Ariados have still obtained a very bad reputation. In media,  they are usually portrayed as sneak thieves (Ariados can get almost anywhere with a little effort,  and could make incredible thieves if they tried hard enough) or as stock enemies in video games. There is also a famous poem involving the interaction of an Ariados and an unfortunate Vibrava,  who makes the extremely fatal mistake of stepping into the Ariadoss parlor.
<p></p>The venom of both members of the line (although Ariadoss more often,  due to its higher lethality) has been researched as a non-polluting pesticide. Because the venom does no harm if ingested,  and does not appear to kill plants,  it can be sprayed on a garden to deter Bug Pokémon from attacking the plants.

</div>what? no mention of the false face on their backs? Pretty good otherwise.
<p></p>@rmc: I get the core as yolk thing,  I was more wondering about what factors determine if a Roggenrolla has enough "yolk" to last until evolution. Or maybe I should be asking about what factors determine when a Roggenrolla will evolve.
<p></p>and as for the sturdy thing,  that actually makes sense now that I think about it,  since 1HKO move don't actually do any damage and thus can't drop a sturdy mon to 1 hp.

<p></p><h1> Swablu Line</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<ul ><li> Swablu [333]
</li><li> Altaria [334]
</li></ul><p></p>Swablu and Altaria are avian Pokemon noted for their unusual wings and Altaria's marked physiological differences from its unevolved form.  Swablu is small,  less than half a metre tall,  and weighs roughly half a kilogram,  though older Pokedexes incorrectly list this weight as 1.2 kilograms,  not pounds.  It has a bright blue roughly spherical body with a short curved beak,  ideal for cracking seeds and nuts,  and it has a pair of large,  fluffy white wings that look very much like clouds.  It has tiny,  almost vestigial feet,  and a short set of tail feathers and two plumes extending from the top of its head.  Altaria is significantly taller,  close to 1.2 metres,  and is significantly heavier (though again older Pokedexes have the weight incorrect,  listing it as 20.6 kilograms as opposed to pounds).  Altaria is no longer spherical,  having a distinct neck,  and its feet,  tail and plumes are all significantly longer and better-developed.  It also has white patches on its cheeks and it usually keeps its much-longer wings folded around itself,  making it look like it is wreathed in clouds.
There are rare individuals of both species with a non-heritable mutation that causes their bodies to be gold instead of blue.  They are prized by collectors even more so than most colour-variant Pokemon,  as their feathers can be collected and sold without harming the Pokemon.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
Amongst Flying-type Pokemon,  Swablue and Altaria have very unusual wings.  They appear to be clouds,  but are in fact an intricate network of bone projections,  folded skin and muscle and soft,  cottony feathers.  This structure makes the wings exceedingly flexible,  allowing the Pokemon to change their shape,  though it is an energy-intensive procedure.  Swablu and Altaria take off by shifting their wings into a more conventional aerodynamic shape,  and flap a couple of times at most.  Once they have some speed,  they relax,  letting their wings assume the more normal cloudlike shape,  and glide off of thermals and other air currents.  An analysis of the skeletal structure of the wing would suggest,  despite the typical durability of a flying Pokemon's skeleton,  that the wing would be very fragile due to the sheer number of bones in it.  However,  Swablu and Altaria have even tougher bones than normal,  and the tissue and feathers do act a little as shock absorbers.  Their wings are not immune to damage,  however,  and more so than with other bird Pokemon,  if a Swablu or Altaria breaks its wing badly enough,  it is almost certainly doomed.  This seems to be most evident in a rare subspecies that has an unusual phenotype where it <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMolt' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMolt'>constantly produces and sheds feathers</a>,  which settle on everything nearby.  Surprisingly,  this seems to partially disrupt many effects of strong localised weather systems on Pokemon,  with these feathers being noted to (in a battle) suppress the regenerative abilities of many Water-types,  shield against scouring sand,  disrupt ice crystal formation,  and more.  These Swablu and Altaria do not have the advanced immune system and regenerative abilities that the majority of the species have,  allowing them to recover from debilitating illnesses and some kinds of injuries by simply resting for a while.  Pokeballs seem to accelerate this effect,  allowing a Swablu or Altaria to get over something like being poisoned in seconds if they are called back.  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing'>It is theorised that the lack of an advanced immune system to deal with infection is the reason why the molting-phenotype is so rare - without a completely solid immune system,  a single scratch in their wings could cause an infection and destroy them.</a>
<p></p>Swablu are very curious birds,  and completely unafraid of humans and many other Pokemon,  though they do know to steer clear of predators.  They will <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadPet' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadPet'>often land on the head of a person or a larger Pokemon</a>,  which they will use as an observation platform.  They are also obsessed with shiny things,  and will polish anything that looks like it could be shiny with its wings.  It will then wash its dirty wings in the nearest water source.  This desire to clean is impossible to train out of a Swablu,  though it vanishes almost completely when it evolves.  It is not immediately obvious,  but a Swablu's constant twittering is capable of transmitting a lot of information,  and they are constantly talking about what they see (see Social Structure below).
<p></p>Altaria have a significant number of noteworthy traits compared to Swablu.  The most obvious is the change in its skin underneath its feathers.  Altaria develops scales similar to other Dragon-type Pokemon such as Dragonair and Salamence.  The chemical structure of these scales,  like all Dragon-types,  wards against a great many environmental conditions including heat and electrical shock,  though extreme cold tends to cause them to fracture.  Upon evolution,  it also develops a significant number of small secretion sacs,  also similar to those found in other Dragon-type Pokemon.  These sacs produce chemicals that allow Altaria to use more powerful energy attacks,  including attacks characteristics of Dragon Pokemon.  These changes are what give Altaria the Dragon type.  An Altaria also develops very refined vocal chords,  allowing it to hum constantly at a high soprano pitch.  They do this for communication,  subtly varying the pitch to communicate different ideas.  This humming is very intuitive,  allowing even humans to easily understand what an Altaria is trying to say at a simple level.  The reason for this is unknown.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
Swablu and Altaria typically live in forested or mountainous areas,  with places being both hilly and forested being ideal.  Swablu like being near fast-flowing streams so they can wash their wings,  and populations have been observed in Hoenn near Meteor Falls and in Sinnoh towards the northern end of Mt. Coronet,  though it should be noted they are never found in alpine conditions.  Occasional migratory groups have been observed near Blackthorn City.  Stable Altaria populations have only been observed in Unova in the misty regions near Undella and in Hoenn in the Sky Pillar near Pacifidlog,  though there will be the occasional Altaria amongst a group of Swablu.  Swablu tend to live in nests or at least in a clearly-defined "home" area (visible by how polished and clean they are compared to the rest of the environment),  while Altaria tend to roam more.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
Both Pokemon live off of fruit,  seeds and nuts.  While a Swablu's dietary requirements are quite modest,  <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater'>Altaria need a huge amount of food,  and are capable of consuming over three kilogram in fruit per day in certain circumstances</a>.  Migratory Altaria will often descend upon orchards,  gorging on the fallen fruit - and any of the fruit still left on the trees,  for that matter.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
Swablu are almost completely harmless to humans.  Their beaks can give a sharp nip,  and they will fight back with them if disturbed with no way of escaping,  but the injuries they can cause are nothing that will require anything more than a bandage.  They do have the potential to be irritating to certain kinds of people and Pokemon with their behaviour,  but most tend to find it endearing.
<p></p>Altaria are more powerful than Swablu,  but are difficult to provoke.  Most are content to fly away if threatened and will only fight back under extreme duress.  They fight in a similar way to Swablu,  however they can exert greater force,  which can result in significant bruising and tearing.  Altaria are also capable of using energy attacks similar to many dragons.  The real threat posed by an Altaria is their vitality.  The structure of their scales gives them resilience to physical blows and even more resillience to energy attacks,  usually the typical way of dealing with a flying Pokemon that spends much of its time out of reach.  Further,  Altaria can often spend a few moments to regenerate injuries at a remarkable rate,  shield themselves from harmful effects and the like.  If an Altaria has taken issue with something you have done,  be prepared for a long,  protracted battle.  The exception to this is if you have access to Ice attacks - not only are an Altaria's scales vulnerable to cold,  low temperatures interfere with their ability to control their wing structure,  allowing a single well-placed attack to send them crashing into the ground.
<p></p>Finally,  a handful of Altaria can have access to a couple of rare,  powerful techniques.  The more common one is the ability to sing a debilitating song,  similar to some <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Misdreavus' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Misdreavus'>Misdreavus</a>.  Anyone within earshot will rapidly find themselves falling unconscious,  including the Altaria itself - though it will recover quickly.  The other,  rarer one is the dreaded Sky Attack technique mostly known thanks to the legendary bird of fire,  Moltres.  The Altaria focuses energy and begins to glow a bright orange-red colour,  before charging at incredible speeds at a target while the energy buildup protects the Altaria from harm while executing the dive.  If an Altaria begins glowing,  either knock it unconscious immediately or find cover.  It should be noted that these abilities very rarely observed in the wild,  and more commonly observed among the Altaria of veteran Trainers
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
Both Swablu and Altaria breed in the wild during Spring,  though they both have differing courtship rituals.  A male Swablu will take exceptional effort to clean up their nest,  collect unusual shiny objects and keep themselves clean to impress a potential mate.  If she approves,  they will produce one or two eggs between them and raise the offspring together until the next Spring.  Altaria do not collect shiny things,  instead using songs to determine potential mates.  Both males and females hum complex tunes with the aim to impress their desired mate.  They will then raise their offspring together like Swablu,  however Altaria have much larger clutches,  reaching as much as ten in size.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
Swablu and Altaria both live in large flocks,  though flocks consisting mostly of Altaria can only appear where there is enough food to support them.  They are always in constant communication with each other,  telling any of their flock members within earshot about what they are seeing and doing.  Both Pokemon are quite intelligent and have been demonstrated to be able to understand concepts like colour.  They continue to communicate with each other even during times of crisis such as the presence of a large predator.  The most inquisitive Swablus tend to inherently rise towards leadership in the flock,  as they are the ones doing much of the talking.  Altaria are generally less busy exploring than Swablu,  so their flocks have less of a leadership structure and are similar to a group of equals.  While they are still in constant communication with each other,  studies have demonstrated Altaria do not communicate anywhere near as much information as Swablu do.
<p></p><h2> In Popular Culture</h2>
Swablu are very popular Pokemon with a lot of good press.  In particular,  their love of cleaning and polishing makes them a great boon on households,  which will always be clean while there is a Swablu around (assuming it is the common non-shedding subspecies).  Every now and again there will be complaints from some Pokemon rights groups claiming that using Swablu like this is similar to slave labour; however it has been very strongly established by numerous studies that Swablu like cleaning - and in fact react very badly if forced to stay in an environment that they cannot clean.  Their inquisitive nature and cute appearance also guarantees them showing up in leading and supporting roles in many children's television shows and books,  as well as showing up as guest characters to teach that,  "Cleaning is fun!"
<p></p>Altaria are also very popular,  but not quite as much - farmers in eastern Unova cannot grow fruit if they want to keep the crop despite the conditions being perfect.  Their beautiful humming is believed to have a calming effect and Altaria-song is popular in the alternative medicine trade.  Because they are also a dragon,  Altaria are popular amongst trainers and have earned a certain mystique from being dragons alone,  even if as far as dragons go they are not that powerful.  The head and tail feathers of Altaria are said to have many mystical properties,  with one of the most famous examples of an Altaria magic feather in fiction (<a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather'>which was actually not at all magical</a>) being <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dumbo' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dumbo'>used by a Phanpy to fly</a>.

</div>One thing I think we need to fix for all the articles on the whole- we need to have a definite answer on whether or not there are real animals in the Pokemon universe. Some articles say there are,  others say there aren't.
<p></p>I believe there are other animals,  and here are a few reasons:
<p></p><ul ><li> The species thingy that each Pokemon is (for example,  Pikachu is the Tiny Mouse Pokemon). How would they know what those were if they only had 600 points of reference?
</li><li>We've only seen a small area of the Pokeverse. Maybe all the regions we've seen have just had an extremely high Pokemon concentration.
</li><li>There simply <em>aren't enough</em> Pokemon to have a stable environment. We <em>need</em> millions of different species of fauna to survive.

</div>A single kilogram of food isn't that much (only about 2.2 pounds) especially for something of Altaria's size.

</div>It's roughly one-tenth of its body weight,  we generally don't eat one-tenth of our body weight.  But I guess humans aren't <em>that</em> big eaters anyway,  so it could stand to be larger.  Two kilos?  Three?
