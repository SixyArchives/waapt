In-universe,  I don't see it discovered much later than any of the other types. Some of the Fairy mons are popular enough among trainers in-universr (seriously,  how many Lasses use Jigglypuff in the Kanto based games?) that should have studied in-depth.
<p></p>The current situation with the Kalos games seems similar to what happened with the Johto games. It was said in GSC that the Steel had just been discovered. Cue RSE,  that happens 3 years earlier,  they're widely known and the Champion even specialices in them. Cue HGSS,  retconning,  the Steel type has been known for ages.

Feel free to take a look over it and see how it is if it's acceptable to be a part of the Fanon Pokedex.
<p></p>-
<p></p>Morphs
<p></p>Pumpkaboo (#710)
Gourgeist (#711)
<p></p>Pumpkaboo is a ghostly Pokemon that resembles a pumpkin with two circular holes carved out of its rind,  giving the resemblance of eyes,  and two tiny stubs protrude out from the bottom. Its upper half is black with a pointy,  leafy-like collar. Its head is curved bump on the top,  with two protruded points that resemble ears,  giving the head a resemblance to either a bat or a cat. A curled stem protrudes out from its head in-between its ears.
<p></p>Pumpkaboos come in various sizes,  ranging from 100 to 104 for smaller sizes to 108 to 207 for larger sizes. Their weight ranges as well,  depending on their size. Smaller ones can range from weighing 7.7 lbs to 11.o lbs,  while larger ones can range 16.5 lbs to 33.1 lbs.
<p></p>Gourgeist maintains a similar,  yet different build from Pumpkaboo after evolving. Its lower half is still a pumpkin with two small stubs on the bottom,  but instead of two circular holes,  it has two holes and a crescent carved out of its rind,  resembling a smiling face. Its upper half is long,  slender stump-like protrusion rising out of the pumpkin half. Its face is located at the top of the stump-like protrusion,  featuring a pair of yellow eyes and a small mouth with two noticeable fangs. Peach-colored hair sprouts from the top of its head that flows out around with two lock down the back,  one bang that covers one of its eyes in a curled formation,  and two long locks that flow down its sides to its pumpkin half,  each developing into a three-fingered hand. Its curled stem turns into a curved idiot hair thats dark on one side and peach on the other side. Gourgeist features of a reverse pallet-swap of Pumpkaboos colors,  with its pumpkin half being a darker color and its upper half being a brighter peach and orange color,  reminiscent of a pumpkins fibrous strands.
<p></p>Like Pumpkaboo,  Gourgeist come in various sizes. The size they were as a Pumpkaboo will determine what size theyll grow when they evolve into a Gourgeist. Their size and weight ranges from 204 and 211 for smaller sizes,  weighing from 20.9 lbs to 27.9 lbs,  to the larger sizes being up to 307 and 507 in height and weighing from 30.9 lbs to 86.0 lbs.
<p></p>-
<p></p>Notable Biology
<p></p>Unlike most Ghost-Type Pokemon,  who either manifests as pure ethereal energy or integrate themselves into the objects they possess,  the Pumpkaboo line is peculiar kind of Ghost-Type that shares a symbiotic relationship with the pumpkins that theyre literally attached to,  rendering them as hybrids of both Ghost-Type and Grass-Type.
<p></p>The pumpkins they inhabit serve as a kind of shell,  protecting them from harm. This may seem strange to most experts of Ghost-Types,  since most Ghost-Type Pokemon have no need for such protection due to being able to phase in and out of visible world,  but theres a common theory that given their symbiotic relationship with the pumpkins they inhabit,  the Pumpkaboo Line is more attached to the physical world than other Ghost-Type Pokemon,  and as such their more ghostly attributes are more limited. One such example would that they have limited phasing,  that while their upper halves can still phase through solid matter,  their pumpkins halves cant.
<p></p>The carved eyes on Pumpkaboos pumpkin half can act as flashlights to either guide humans through dark places,  or to scare away potential predators. Gourgeist lose this ability,  but the faces on its pumpkin half still glows,  though in a more ominous way,  acting as another kind defense mechanism,  tricking potential predators into think that its a big intimidating creature that shouldnt be messed with.
<p></p>Male and Female Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists are visually indistinguishable from each other. The fact that their voices sound uncannily similar to human women doesnt help either. However,  after careful observations,  Ghost-Type experts have been able to tell the difference between male and female just by their voices. Female Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists voices sound more soft and clear,  while male Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists voices sound more raspy.
<p></p>-
<p></p>Habitat
<p></p>Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists are usually found in any environment where wild squash and gourds grow,  usually in grassy fields or deep forests.
<p></p>More domesticated Pumpkaboo and Gourgeist are found in areas that are dominated by human agriculture,  most particularly around farms and orchards. A pumpkin patch is always an ideal place for Pumpkaboos and Gourgeist to gather in,  finding a place of community as well as finding suitable pumpkins for their offspring.
<p></p>-
<p></p>Diet
<p></p>Due to their symbiotic nature,  Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists share the same kind of diet that plants and flora have,  such as water,  sun,  and rich soil. They can still feed on negative energies,  though their methods of doing so are drastically different.
<p></p>As of the more recent years,  domesticated Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists have developed a taste for human-made sugary products,  particularly candy,  and if they see any in their sight,  they wouldnt hesitate to eat it.
<p></p>-
<p></p>Hazards
<p></p>For the most part,  Pumpkaboos are harmless Pokemon,  and would only become hostile when antagonized by a predator or an obnoxious human. Even though they can feed on negative emotions,  they wont go scaring humans for a quick meal. If anything,  theyll more often focus their diet on water,  soil,  and sunlight,  and (if domesticated) candy.
<p></p>Their evolved form,  Gourgeist,  however,  is a completely different story.
<p></p>As a whole,  Ghost-Type Pokemon are often misunderstood pranksters,  but only so few have ever built up such an infamous reputation as the Gourgeists. Gourgeists are in love with their own voices,  and commonly enjoy expressing that love through singing. However,  their songs carry powerful curses that can affect others through simply hearing them. Made worse is that these Pokemon have a tendency to wander their way into human towns and cities on moonless nights to sing for any unfortunate audience. The curses afflicted vary,  but are mostly minor and temporary. A common curse thats afflicted is a unique one that appears to be exclusive to the Pumpkaboo line; it transfers some of its ghostly energy into a subject that temporarily makes them partially Ghost-Type,  providing the subject with both the strengths and weaknesses of a Ghost-Type Pokemon. Other times,  however,  the curses can be more dangerous,  traumatizing,  and even life-threatening to the victims.
<p></p>Domesticated Gourgeist,  however,  have been raised and nurtured to where they can sing while suppressing their curse-casting powers,  though sometimes a minor curse might still slip out while it is feeling overjoyed.
<p></p>Theres more to Gourgeists infamous reputation than just the curse-casting. Most Ghost-Type Pokemon would scare and prank both humans and other Pokemon primarily for the purpose harvesting on the negative emotions that are produced from the results,  but would never actually try to harm their prey unless provoked. What really cements it is that Gourgeists takes this a whole new level,  possessing an almost fundamental desire to cause suffering. When a Gourgeist catches its prey,  regardless if its another Pokemon or a human,  it will enwrap its arm-like hair around its prey and starts to subject it to torment. A common method of torment would be slowly constricting the prey with their hair and watching the prey struggle and squirm in response. This observation seems to fill with a Gourgeist with utter joy that motivates them to sing in joy in response to their preys suffering,  which in turn ends up cursing them with further ailments. Some would go further and attempt to strangle and hit their prey and watch in glee as their life slowly seeps from their bodies. However,  once done,  most Gourgeists would leave their prey alive,  albeit traumatized,  and then wander off.
<p></p>Even domesticated Gourgeists are not exempt from this sadistic,  innate urge,  and as such are met with suspicion and distrust from a lot of people. However,  their methods are different from wild Gourgeists. Gourgeists who have been raised in captivity have been raised and interacted with humans since they were Pumpkaboos,  and as such,  have a more developed relationship with humans. The bond they share with their human trainers and human family has allowed them to practice their innate urge in a much less malign way. A common practice they would perform would be enwrapping their human trainer or family member with their arm-like hair and would start tickling them,  taking joy in the unbearable laughter and exhaustion that they inflict on their human owners.
<p></p>Although a small minority,  there have been rare cases where a Gourgeist would attack a human for no practical reason other than the sheer thrill of ending that humans life through the worst curses imaginable and strangling and beating them to death. Coupled with this and with everything above,  its no surprise that many people condemn this Pokemon Line as vile,  evil creatures.
<p></p>-
<p></p>Courting and Childrearing
<p></p>Both Morphs are capable of reproduction,  though cases of Pumpkaboos reproducing are rare. Courtships among Gourgeists involve the females trying to attract the males with their songs. A female would waddle up to a male to get its attention and would start singing a song for its potential mate. If the male expresses interest,  then it will join the female in the song and try to synchronize his voice with hers. If successful,  both Gourgeists will find each other as worthy partners and will mate. Once an egg is created,  the female will try to find a suitable pumpkin to place inside. When the egg hatches,  the ghostly energy inside will absorb the pumpkins inside and grow into a new-born Pumpkaboo.
<p></p>Pumpkaboo are mostly self-reliant even after hatching,  but its not uncommon for them to linger around their parents even after being able to take care of themselves. Gourgeists are not exactly known for be parents,  and quickly lose interest after their children hatch from their eggs,  but dont exactly mind their offspring following them around anyway.
<p></p>-
<p></p>Social Structure
<p></p>Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists usually gather together in pumpkin patches. Theyre usually lax creatures who hold no kind of organized structure,  seeing each other as simple neighbors
<p></p>This Pokemon Line becomes most active during the autumn season,  which is when theyre most dangerous. During winter,  they spend most of their time cooped up in their pumpkin shells to keep warm.
<p></p>Pumpkaboos can sometimes be found with other Ghost-Type Pokemon,  such as Ghastly,  Shuppet,  and Phantump,  usually with them following it around wherever it goes.
<p></p>-
<p></p>In Human Culture
<p></p>According to ancient legends,  the Pumpkaboo Line was once revered as spirits of the harvest moon who came down and inhabited fresh and healthy grown crops and vegetables to join humans in festivals that celebrated healthy harvest seasons of bountifully grown food,  and if any who failed present fitting tributes would be haunted by these spirits. While there is no concrete evidence to support these legends,  there is a general consensus among most people that it would explain why this particular Pokemon Line associates itself so much with pumpkins and the autumn season.
<p></p>Pumpkaboos have also been regarded as spirits who lead others to the afterlife,  often due to how they tend to seen with other Ghost-Type Pokemon following behind it. However,  there doesnt seem to be substantial evidence to support this claim.
<p></p>As pointed above,  the Pumpkaboo Line is notorious even among Ghost-Type Pokemon to where theres a lot of controversy and debate over having them as viable Pokemon for trainers. Some argue that Gourgeists are inherently vile,  evil monsters who would harm others for the thrills of making others suffer,  and thus shouldnt be allowed to co-exist among people. Some would even argue for the mass eradication of the Pumpkaboo Line entirely. Others would argue that while indeed dangerous,  Gourgeists can be raised and trained to not harm others and can even be friendly and loving Pokemon. While domesticated Pumpkaboo and Gourgeists are legal to be owned,  and thus are protected under law from acts of vigilantism,  members who live in the wild are consider fair game among some mindsets and thus when one stumbles too close to human settlements,  people to get together to hunt down and kill them. However,  even those who are domesticated and legally owned face suspicion and distrust among people.
<p></p>Since Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists tend to gather in pumpkin patches,  theres the risk of farmers losing their business stocks,  and thus theres now a legal program that creates separate pumpkin patches exclusively for Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists to socialize in without worry of farmers losing their gardens. Due to the fact that the Pumpkaboo Line becomes most active during the autumn season,  some human towns and cities that have a sizeable population of these Pokemon within them or within nearby areas would employ barriers and patrol teams that use Pokemon of the Fire,  Flying,  Bug,  Ice,  Ghost,  and Dark Types to ward off any wild Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists that may try to wander into the streets.
<p></p>The glowing carves eyes and faces on Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists is commonly used as defense mechanism to ward off potential predators,  and especially works on scaring away other Ghost-Type Pokemon. Humans have learned of these characteristics and have integrated them into their culture and customs on special occasions; the most iconic of these special occasions is Halloween,  where people would buy pumpkins from any local pumpkin patch that sells them and turn them into Jack-O-Lanterns,  carving a variety of faces into them and putting a lit candle inside them,  thus imitating the ominous glowing face of a Gourgeists pumpkin half used to scare away wicked spirits. Just like with other creepy Pokemon,  there have been costumes made based on Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists for kids,  teens,  and adults. Sometimes families will even take their pet Pumpkaboos and Gourgeists out to go trick-or-treating with them,  an activity that these Pokemon love,  for they can get a lot of delicious candy to eat.
<p></p>In popular media,  Pumpkaboos are rarely featured in stories,  but its most popular role is the Halloween special of the kids cartoon show,  Walnuts,  as a legendary holiday icon known as The Great Pumpkaboo. Gourgeists,  however,  are more prominently featured in stories of horror,  adventure,  and dark fantasy,  often as villainous monsters that terrorize the heroes. One of the rare,  non-villainous roles of Gourgeist is the highly popular and critically acclaimed Halloween movie,  The Nighterror before the Holidays,  whose protagonist is a super-sized Gourgeist named Jackie the Pumpkin Queen,  who becomes highly fascinated by the other holidays outside of Halloween and wants to experience those holidays in her own way,  much to the expense of the other famous holiday icons.
<p></p>-
<p></p>Trainers Notes
<p></p>For any trainers who are interested in owning a member of this Pokemon Line,  its important to consult both an expert of Ghost-Type Pokemon and an expert of Grass-Type Pokemon. Understanding the needs of owning these particular Pokemon would help you be more prepared. After youre done,  contact the nearest farm or orchard in your local area to make arrangements. Its highly advised to adopt a domestic Pumpkaboo,  for they are the easiest to train and raise so that once it evolves into a Gourgeist,  its close relationship with you should be able to motivate it into not accidentally cursing you.
<p></p>Pumpkaboos and Gourgeist prefer a decent amount of open space for them to wander about freely. They can easily become claustrophobic and mentally unhealthy if theyre kept inside small tight spaces like a room for most of their lives. If you live in an area that shares a low tolerance for the Pumpkaboo Line,  its advisable to keep your other Pokemon close to your Pumpkaboo/Gourgeist,  because even though they are protected by the law from being hunted and kill,  there will still be the risk of a vigilante unleashing a Pokemon onto your Pumpkaboo/Gourgeist with the intention to kill it and make it look like an accident.
<p></p>Like with most Ghost-Type Pokemon,  a trainer would have to be the kind that has a high tolerance for a Gourgeists mischievous behavior,  and should at least expect it to give you the greatest tickling of your life.
<p></p>If any trainer wishes to capture a member of this line in the wild,  its advisable and preferable to capture a wild Pumpkaboo. They are a bit harder to train and raise than a domesticated Pumpkaboo,  but it would generally still be easy to care for it in a way that wont be detrimental to your health or life. Capturing a wild Gourgeist,  however,  is highly discouraged,  for it would hold a grudge against the one who captured it and would attempt to make its trainers life a living hell,  prompting the trainer to release it back into the wild. Encountering a wild Pumpkaboo poses no threat to trainers unless continuously provoked,  but encountering a wild Gourgeist can be one of the most dangerous things for any trainer. Starting trainers and inexperienced trainers are highly advise to not confront a wild Gourgeist and instead to run away,  for attacking a wild Gourgeist unprepared would have it retaliate by entangling the trainer with its hair and subjecting him/her to the worst kind of curses and strangling imaginable. More experienced trainers are still in danger to an encounter with a wild Gourgeist,  so it would be advisable to have a stronger Pokemon that has a Type advantage against it.

<p></p><h2>General Characteristics</h2>
<p></p>One of the rarer Pokémon types out there and also one of the most misunderstood. Most dark type Pokémon have black,  dark blue and dark purple coloring. This aids in camouflage due to the fact that most of them are nocturnal. This is also were the type gets its name,  however despite the name few dark type techniques have anything to do with darkness or night. What really makes a technique a dark type is in the primary way that the move is used. They use what most people would consider dirty fighting moves like sneak attacks and false emotions. Because of this in some cultures,  most notably within the regions of Kanto,  Johto,  Hoenn,  and Sinnoh,  these Pokémon are instead referred to as evil type Pokémon. This of course has lead to the belief that many Dark type Pokémon are actively malevolent,  most notably the Pokémon Absol.
<p></p><h2>Powers</h2>
In combat the true strength of the dark type is against ghost and psychic type Pokémon. It is not fully understood why dark types are so effective against these two types but the most accepted theory is that the brains of dark type Pokémon creates what is called a negative energy field that both ghost and psychic types are especially vulnerable too. When attacking ghost Pokémon with a dark technique it is believed that the negative energy enters the body of a ghost Pokémon and causes the normally intangible Pokémon to disperse more than usual,  making it hard for them to reform. Against psychic types it is believed that the negative energy causes great mental pain to a psychic type when they come into contact with it. They are also strong against both of these types defensively as the fright tactics that most ghost Pokémon use is ineffective against the naturally night dwelling Pokémon and against psychic types it has been shown that dark Pokémon are completely immune to the mental powers of psychic types and this is believed to be a side effect of the negative energy field.
<p></p>It has also been shown that dark Pokémon are vulnerable to the powers of bug Pokémon,  this is because the hyper strong senses and simpler minds of most bug Pokémon are able to perceive dark Pokémon easily and are unlikely to fall for their many tricks. It is also true that dark types are ineffective against their own type as the sneaky tricks of the dark type often will not work against those that know what is coming. Dark types however are very vulnerable to two main types; the fighting and fairy type. For the fighting type it has been observed that in combat the training and mental strength of the fighting type allows them to predict the sneaky techniques of the dark type,  turning a potentially devastating blow into a glancing one,  and counter adoringly. It has also been suggested that the fighting type sees dark techniques as cowardly and dishonorable and will deliberately strike with more force than usual in order to punish them. It has also been shown that against the recently discover fairy type that dark type Pokémon are highly ineffective. The reasons for this are unclear but building off the negative energy field shown above many researchers believe that fairy Pokémon emit an opposing positive energy field that somehow counter acts the power of dark Pokémon.
<p></p><h2>Morphology</h2>
<p></p>The forms of dark type Pokémon vary widely,  primarily because most dark types are duel typed and will often take on characteristics of their second type. Some common characteristics include dark colorizations and,  in general,  an aggressive look to them. This is to help them ward away potential threats. For pure dark Pokémon they are commonly in the form of mammalian creatures and because of this before the dark type was officially classified many of these Pokémon were considered normal types instead.
<p></p><h2>Diet</h2>
<p></p>The majority of dark Pokémon are carnivores or omnivores leaning towards carnivores. The only known dark type to be a herbivore is Umbreon,  being the evolved form of Eevee,  a Pokémon who through generations of domestication have been breed to live off a primarily plant based diet.
<p></p><h2>Breeding</h2>
<p></p>The mating habits of the dark type vary widely and are often based on the Pokémons second type or species. It has been observed that if the Pokémon lives a generally solitary life that they will mostly take multiple different mates throughout their life but if they are a species that lives in a group they tend to take a single lifelong mate instead.

Otherwise,  the name would seem to come out of nowhere.

<p></p><h2> <span>Wooper Line</span></h2>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Wooper [#194]  Ambystoma Johticus
</li><li> Quagsire [#195]  Andrias J.
</li></ul><p></p><strong>Wooper</strong> is a small amphibious Pokémon that many people liken to a tadpole. It stands at approximately 0.4 meters (14) and will have a weight of about 8.5 kilograms (18.7 pounds). It has a small slender body with a wide flat tail to aid in balance. This is necessary as the Wooper also has a large oval shaped head almost twice the width of its body and two small round feet. Interestingly for a bipedal Pokémon it lacks any form of arms or even fins to aid in swimming. The evolutionary reason for such an obvious disadvantage is a topic that many Pokémon researchers will hotly discuss. On each side of its head is an organ known as an external gill. In the male Wooper it will consist of a long central stalk (rami) with two pairs or adjacent stalks branching out,  one near the base and one near the tip. A female Wooper will instead have a single pair of branching stalks near the base. The stalks contain muscle tissue allowing limited control over them. Each stalk is lined by many thinly walled filaments (fimbriae),  containing the majority of blood vessels used in gas exchange. These allow the Wooper to breathe underwater while allowing the presence of lungs in the body. The majority of Wooper have a light blue coloring to its skin with small black eyes and three dark blue stripes located on its belly with its external gills being or a purple color. A small minority of Wooper have a mutation that causes them to have a light pink color to their skin with light yellow stripes and orange gills.
<p></p><strong>Quagsire</strong> is the adult form of Wooper and is notably much larger. It will grow to able 1.4 meters (47) in height and will weight a massive 75 kilograms (165.3 pounds). It has a large,  broad body with a head just as round and wide to the point that it is difficult to tell were the head,  neck and body begin and end. In addition its wide head has a very wide mouth that allows it to consume any of it prey in one bite. In this form it grows two short arms ending in three digits and its feet also have developed three digits. On its back a wavy purple strip now runs from the base of its head to its tail and along its spine is a fin. This fin is somewhat larger on the male then on the female. In this form it loses the external gills it had before but it has instead a highly permeable skin that functions as a secondary respiratory surface. This allows limited breathing underwater but unlike its younger counterpart it cannot stay underwater indefinitely. Like the Wooper the main color this Pokémon is light blue with the fin being a dark blue. Those that evolved from a Wooper with the mutation above have a light purple skin with the stripe on its back being a grey color and the fin a dark purple color.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>Interestingly the Wooper line of Pokémon is one of only a handful of Pokémon that exhibits characteristics of both the water type and the ground type making it completely immune to attacks with the electric typing but leaving it highly vulnerable to grass Pokémon.
<p></p>To compensate for its weak sense of sight,  smell,  and hearing these Pokémon have developed a sensory organ called a lateral line system that allows them to detect movement and vibration in the water using modified epithelial cells known as hair cells that respond to displacement of the water. It is because of this system that one of the more odd behaviors of the Quagsire can be explained. It has been noted by fishermen on boats near were Quagsire swim that they will often swim into boat hulls. Once thought to being the result of them being stupid it has been shown that because of their lateral line system showing them the movement of boats along with the natural tendency of ground Pokémon to understand their surroundings that they are simply trying to figure out a part of their environment they do not understand.
<p></p>When these Pokémon leave the water they coat themselves in a thin poisonous film to prevent them from dehydrating. This film will cause a shooting pain in any human that touches it barehanded; therefore it is advised that any person who wishes to touch one were rubber gloves. Though this film is not powerful enough for them to be classified as a poison Pokémon with enough training either of these Pokémon can learn to gather up this poison in order to pack up into a ball and fling it or to release it as a small wave to hit multiple targets.
<p></p>It is often believed that Quagsire are especially lazy and easygoing,  to the point that it will just lay in one spot and just open it mouth until prey goes into its mouth. This behaviour however has only been observed in Quagsire in captivity as they have learned that their human keepers will eventually feed them so as a signal that they are hungry they will simply open their mouths until food id given to them. Also because of their rather thickset build it is believed that they are fat and weak but this very far from the truth. In truth they are full of muscle and with proper training they can learn to carry a trainer across large pools of water,  swim up waterfalls with a trainer,  move large boulders and learn other powerful techniques such as Rock Slide,  Earthquake and Giga Impact.
<p></p>Within the species three subspecies have been observed; the first when threatened will release a fine mist around itself. This mist is not strong enough to inflict any harm but does interfere with the chemical process that some Pokémon are capable of producing that allows them to self-destruct. The second has a more porous skin then others of its kind. This allows them to draw nutrients directly from the water and during battle gives them a minor healing ability when hit with a water type attack. This has the side effect of rendering them unable to absorb air through their skin and as such Quagsires with this mush come up to breath more often. The third and rarest shows a rudimentary psychic ability that allows them to prevent threats from using techniques that will increase (or decrease) either their strength or their toughness,  both physical and mental. Because of their preserved stupidity and laziness it is commonly joked that they instead simply do not notice that their foes are stronger.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>The Wooper line is indigenous to the Johto/Kanto region and as such the majority of the species is found in that area. They prefer to live in areas with large amounts of still or slow moving water and so inhabit the large rivers,  marshes and swamps or the area. As a nocturnal species they will sleep through most of the day light hours and during them are generally hard to find. During the day they will bury themselves under mud whether on the land or under water for both protection and to keep them cool and if they are on the land and are unable to find any suitable mud are known to sleep within rotten logs.
<p></p>Within the Johto region the most well-known location to find Wooper is Route 32 south of Violet city. This area is near a large spawning ground for the species and as such contains a large number of young curious Wooper that wonder the grasses near the shore. Because of this Wooper in Johto are considered a good beginner Pokémon for new trainers in the region. Quagsire are found in various rivers and shores across the Johto/Kanto area with Routes 26&amp;27 being the most well-known. They have also been seen dwelling within under water pools in the many caves in the region though these Wooper and Quagsire rarely leave the water as the soil is too hard for them and they are more vulnerable.
<p></p>These Pokémon have also been seen in small numbers in other regions in the world,  often staying in one location and not spreading. It is believed that these Pokémon are the descendent of feral Wooper and Quagsire that were released by their owners. In the Sinnoh region they have been spotted in the wetter southern portion of route 212 and within the great marsh. In Kalos the swamps of routes 14 and 19 are home to small numbers of Quagsires.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>The Wooper line of Pokémon is almost entirely carnivorous and will only rarely eat plant matter if desperate enough due to their fear of grass Pokémon and the potential of accidentally nibbling on one. Both Pokémon being rather slow,  even in the water,  have become ambush predators that must slowly approach without being sensed in order to attack. This is why they prefer still waters as they often get more clouded and as such make it easier to sneak up on prey. Woopers feed primarily on small fish and crustaceans and Quagsire can hunt much larger prey like Magikarp,  Goldeen,  and Krabby. They are also one of the few Pokémon capable of hunting the Chinchou line of Pokémon as the Quagsires natural ground typing protects it from the Chinchous electrical attacks.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>Both of these Pokémon are considered to be highly docile (especially those rose in captivity) and in the wild will almost always run before fighting and will only fight if they feel they are cornered. In the wild a Wooper in unlikely to be a big threat but a wild Quagsire can get very strong and can overwhelm an unprepared trainer.
<p></p>Because of their gentle nature it is common for parents to get their child a young Wooper as a first pet Pokémon,  though there are still some hazards with them as,  stated above,  they are covered in a painful film so it must be noted that any child that has one cannot touch it. Also of note for the parents is that young Wooper like to play rough and if playing with your child out side will almost inevitably hit them in the face with a water gun and will likely start slashing around in the mud. If you get your child a pet Wooper they will get messy. A Quagsire raised in captivity is also an easy Pokémon to care for but they have been known to get snippy when they are hungry or tired.
<p></p>A Wooper caught in the wild will take some time to adjust to its new lifestyle but with proper care and training will soon become loyal to its trainer,  making it an easy Pokémon for a beginner trainer to raise. Wild Quagsire on the other hand are much harder to control and find it much harder to adjust. It is recommended that only experienced trainers attempt the capture them as without both dedicated care and training they are likely to run away at the first opportunity.
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>In the wild it is only the Quagsire that will mate as the Wooper are considered juvenile and in the wild Wooper lack the natural desire to procreate and are more focused on survival; however Pokémon breeds have been successful in breeding older Wooper in captivity. During mating season,  around mid-fall,  large numbers of Quagsire will travel upstream into the smaller creeks and rivers up in the mountains that they themselves were born. Once they arrive they go ashore and the males line up to present themselves to the females. When looking for a mate the female is looking for one that has a lot of fat as that is seen as a sign of a successful hunter and they are looking at the size,  color,  and condition of the spinal fin as that is an indicator of the Quagsires health. If a suitable mate is found the pair travel into the water and dig out a small hole in the river bottom. The female then lays a clutch of up to 20 eggs. At this time the unfertilized eggs are still soft and lack a shell. Once they are fertilized they will develop a hard shell within a few days. After being laid and fertilized the parents will bury the eggs under rocks or mud and return downstream,  this is to both protect them from predators and to keep them warm throughout the winter. Early next spring the eggs hatch and the Wooper begin traveling downstream to more open waters. In the wild the adult Quagsire normally take no part in raising the young Wooper though some protective behaviour has been observed (see social structure below).
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>In the wild Quagsire live a mostly solitary life and will hunt for food and rest on its own,  however unlike many solitary Pokémon Quagsires generally do not mind having others of its own kind around so long as they are not competing for the same food. To avoid this when Quagsire occupy the same body of water they will naturally attempt to spread themselves out in order to give each other as much space as possible. If this is not possible and two Quagsire must come into conflict they will first try to make themselves look as big as possible to scary the other away,  if that isnt enough they will engage in a battle using their water guns to try and push the other away. The winner gains the right to hunt and the loser must go away and look for another place to hunt.
<p></p>Wooper on the other hand like to be together and will move across the water in large groups of around 8-10. This is a method of protecting themselves much like herd behaviour as the large numbers will frighten off the more cowardly predators and if they are attacked they will scatter giving a higher chance of survival to the ones that arent targeted. Of course being highly curious it is not uncommon for Wooper to leave the group and go exploring on land,  leaving them vulnerable to both predators and trainers.
<p></p><h2> In Human Society</h2>
<p></p>Quagsire hold a very unusual place in modern society; despite being a water type often in fiction they are associated with fire. This is despite the fact that so far no Wooper or Quagsire has shown to be able to use any fire techniques naturally,  with training or through breeding. In the old alchemical teachings of Pokecelsus Quagsires are fire elementals (the others are Digletts for earth,  Togetics for air and Milotics for water). How this association came to be is most likely the result of young Wooper sleeping in rotten logs during the day time if they are unable to get to water or mud. When people would take the logs back to their homes to burn to cook their meals the Wooper in the logs would run out fleeing from the flames. To these people it would look like the flames themselves gave birth to the Wooper giving rise to the connection between them and fire.
<p></p>In popular culture this has led to Quagsire being a fairly common enemy or familiar creature in many <a class='createlink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGs'>RP Gs</a> and fantasy novels associated with fire. One particular example of this is in a tabletop miniature war game set in a dystopian far future in which one group of post-human super soldiers that are known for their use of fire based weaponry are called the Quagsires.
