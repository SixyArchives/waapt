</div>And,  as proof that I <em>haven't</em> been completely distracted by WAAPT,  I present to you...
<p></p><div class="wmglead" ><strong>Machop Line</strong></div>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Machop [066]
</li><li> Machoke [067]
</li><li> Machamp [068]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Physical Description</h2>
<p></p>The Pokémon of the Machop line are reptilian humanoids that are characterized by immense strength,  bodies with a markedly higher concentration of muscle by body mass,  and a bodyplan that undergoes progressive alterations with each successive evolution. In all stages,  females have been noted to trend physically larger than their male counterparts.
<p></p>The initial morph of this line,  Machop,  is a tailed humanoid that typically stands around 80 centimeters tall and weighs just under 20 kilograms. Machop are characterized by a light blue hide with a set of 3 rigid brown crests running along the top of their heads,  arms with hands with 5 digits and opposable thumbs,  and legs with feet containing a set of fused digits. Other notable features of Machop's body include a short,  broad snout,  two ridged regions along its abdomen (with an appearance akin to that of exposed ribs).
<p></p>The second stage of this line,  Machoke,  is a tailless humanoid with a violet hide and a bodyplan closely mirroring those of human beings that stands an average of 150 centimeters tall and weighs just over 70 kilograms. Beyond the loss of its tail,  Machoke also exhibits a number of other changes to its physical form,  including the emergence of feet with 5 defined digits,  red ridges along its upper and lower arms with an appearance akin to bulging veins,  and more prominent pectoral,  leg,  and arm muscles. Machoke's head also changes dramatically with evolution,  with the emergence of a prominent elongated snout and jaw,  not wholly unlike the cranial changes exhibited in the final evolution of Pokémon in the Squirtle line,  and a set of three head crests that extends from the base of its snout to the back of its head. Machoke are noted for being one of a small number of Pokémon to wear garments,  which consist of a combination of a belt and "spandex". Although the composition and appearance of this belt and "spandex" varies widely upon the setting an individual lives in,  with Machoke in captivity often donning a belt and with black spandex garment that has become virtually eponymous with this Pokemon,  it should be noted that these garments appear to invariably cover all regions of a Machoke's torso below its pectoral muscles.
<p></p>The third,  and presumed final form of the Machop line,  Machamp,  is a six-limbed humanoid creature with a gray hide that averages 160 centimeters in height and 130 kilograms in weight. The most obvious change in Machamp's bodyplan upon its evolution from Machoke is the presence of two sets of arms similar in form to those of its prior forms,  the upper pair further back from a lower pair. Other changes to Machamp's appearance include the loss of its elongated snout as a Machoke in favor of a short snout like that possessed by its initial form,  with yellow-hided "lips, " as well as the loss of three digits each from its feet. Machamp's head crests also change in appearance,  with its set of crests beginning shortly above its eyes and terminating at the back of its head,  with its leftmost and rightmost ridges set at angles,  giving its eyes "brows." Like its prior form,  Machoke,  Machamp are almost always seen with all regions on their torso below their notably larger and bulkier pectoral muscles covered by a belt and garments.
<p></p>In rare circumstances,  individuals exhibiting mutant phenotypes have been recorded. As Machop,  these individuals possess tan hides,  with head crests that are virtually identical in appearance to those of their more normal counterparts. As Machoke,  such individuals exhibit green hides,  and blue ridges along their arms,  with head crests identical in coloration to those of their non-mutant counterparts. As Machamp,  these individuals obtain green hides,  with "lips" and head crests identical in appearance to those of their non-mutant counterparts.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>One of the defining characteristics of Machop and its brethren is their immense relative strength. Although subject to much hyperbole,  which has been exacerbated by data recording errors for older entries for creatures from this line,  all stages of this line are capable of formidable feats,  which includes a capability of lifting objects that several times heavier than their body weight. Contrary to popular belief,  the muscles of Machop and its evolutions are not immune to fatigue,  but appear to have an extremely high tolerance for prolonged or otherwise repeated use.
<p></p>One of the defining biological features of Pokémon from this line is their bodily composition,  a large majority of which consists muscle mass. Contrary to urban legend,  Machop and its evolutions possess a skeletal system,  which is consists almost entirely of cartilaginous bones,  with the exception of the jaws and teeth of these creatures,  which are composed of a more conventional calcium carbonate structure. Early studies of deceased specimens of these creatures had provided inconclusive data regarding their skeletal structures,  which manifested itself in entries in some older Pokédexes,  which maintain that these creatures' bodies are composed entirely of muscle.
<p></p>Machoke and Machamp are also noted to possess an instinctive psychological mechanism that helps to regulate and control how they apply their immense strength. This mechanism appears to be triggered by specific pressure patterns along the lower torso of these creatures,  which appear to be reliably generated by the "belt and spandex" garments that creatures from this line don. In the absence of such pressure patterns,  Machoke and Machamp appear to have a lack of control over a number of muscle groups in their bodies,  most notably the muscles that control Machoke's and Machamp's limbs. There does not appear to be any specific tie between materials or otherwise appearance for these garments beyond the general form of a garb covering all regions of the torso below the pectoral muscles topped by a "belt." In the wild,  these garments are typically constructed out of hide,  with "belts" incorporating weighty objects such as stones. In captivity,  these garments are typically made from fabric,  one of the most commonly used garments consisting of black spandex topped by a belt incorporating metal plates and bits for weight.
<p></p>Pokémon in this line possess an unconventional second evolution,  which appears to be triggered in response to a combination of hormonal and electromagnetic triggers. Individuals vary in responsiveness to these triggers,  with only a small minority of Machoke possessing genes conducive to evolution in a natural setting. It appears that the mechanisms associated with formally trading Pokémon parallel these triggers,  appear to be sufficiently potent to induce evolution among all known individuals. Machoke living in areas with higher than normal background electromagnetic radiation,  such as urban areas,  are also known to more readily evolve into Machamp than their wild counterparts.
<p></p>Creatures from this line have what appear to be three known submorphs,  which appear to be differentiated primarily by different emphases on facets of these creatures' innate psyche. One of the most common of these submorphs consists of individuals that appear to exhibit more aggressive behavior as part of a "fight-or-flight" response when forced to endure a small number of physical afflictions,  a behavior that is dramatically less pronounced among counterparts from outside this submorph. Curiously,  these individuals also appear to have a natural stamina that trends above that of individuals from outside their submorph. Another submorph appears to more naturally gravitate towards close combat,  these individuals also appear to trend below par with individuals outside their submorph in terms of response promptness to stimuli. The third,  and rarest submorph consists of individuals that appear to have a greater emphasis on the "flight" component of these Pokemon's natural "fight or flight" response,  and appear to be capable of moving quicker when recoiling from a sudden shock. The individuals of this third submorph also appear to trend above norm in terms of the development of their leg muscles.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Machop and its evolutions appear to almost instinctively gravitate towards rugged environments presenting ample opportunities for physical training for shelter,  with almost all currently known stable populations of Pokémon from this line having been located in either mountainous regions or in cave systems. Exceptions to this pattern occasionally manifest themselves in folklore,  with some tales speaking of populations of Machop and its evolutions living in non-mountainous environments near their more typical habitats. It is presently unknown to what extent these narratives are based in truth,  though the existence of a stable population of Machop in the regions to the immediate east of Unova's Route 15 appears to lend credence to the at least partial validity of these myths. Stable populations of Pokémon from this line can be found along mountainous passes and cave systems in portions of western and eastern Kanto,  in the vicinity of Mount Mortar and in the southwestern regions of Johto,  in the vicinity of Mt. Ember on Knot Island,  in the surroundings of Mt. Chimney in Hoenn,  and throughout central and eastern Sinnoh.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Pokémon from the Machop line are noted for their relatively fast metabolic rate,  which is just slightly slower than that observed among most comparably-sized mammalian Pokémon. Although creatures from this line appear to be capable of surviving on an omnivorous diet as with most other Pokémon,  wild individuals appear to have diets that trend heavily carnivorous. Creatures from this line do not appear to have a specific preference for quarry,  which generally appears to be only limited by the thickness of a potential prey organism's hide or the presence of toxins. Organisms with physical forms similar to those that Machop and its brethren possess,  such as human beings or Pokémon in the "Human-Like" egg group appear to typically be passed over as potential prey,  with almost all recorded incidences of such behaviors from Pokémon in this line coinciding with periods of extreme scarcity of normal quarry.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>As their immense physical strength would suggest,  unduly antagonizing a creature from the Machop line is an exercise for the extremely foolhardy. All stages of this line use a range of melee techniques,  including techniques incorporating powerful punches and kicks,  which are capable of breaking bones and causing deep bruises when attacked by individuals from the initial stage of this line. Attacks from the latter two stages of this line are vastly more powerful,  and are capable of easily resulting in serious or otherwise life-threatening injuries. All stages of this line also utilize attacks that incorporate the throwing of opponents or foreign objects,  which become increasingly forceful and potent with evolution. Travelers attempting to exploit the typical difficulties that Fighting-Types have in effectively targeting Ghost-Type Pokémon should keep in mind that creatures from this line are known to employ a technique which enables to focus their blows to such a point where Ghost-Types cannot effectively phase through their onslaughts.
<p></p>A small number of other mundane hazards exist for persons in ready contact with these creatures. One of the most notable of which is the significant lack of control that Machoke and Machamp appear to have when their garments are either removed or impaired in some manner. Trainers that encounter such Pokémon are strongly advised to give a wide berth if at all possible. Another hazard of note is the progressively decaying dexterity that Pokémon from this line possess with their digits with each evolution. This phenomena is most pronounced among individuals that have attained the Machamp stage,  which should not be allowed to extensively handle any important belongings that are particularly delicate. As with other Pokemon,  individuals from the Machop line that have not been properly socialized present a significant hazard to the well-being of others,  and are known to be the cause of a number of incidents each year.
<p></p><h2> Courting</h2>
<p></p>All stages of the Machop line are capable of reproducing,  though reproduction among Machop is effectively unheard of in a wild context. Courtship is typically initiated by a male,  who will attempt to impress a potential mate through a combination of displays of physical prowess and sparring with rival suitors. Divergent courtship behaviors are occasionally recorded,  with some populations of these creatures in Sinnoh incorporating gift-giving as a component of courtship rituals,  most notably among the population in the cave systems intersecting Sinnoh's Victory Road. After selecting a suitor,  the female and her chosen male will mate in a secluded area before separating. Pokémon from this line generally do not appear to retain mates for prolonged periods of time,  with most individuals seeking new mates every mating cycle. Despite this,  it appears that creatures from this line maintain ties to particularly strong or accomplished mates,  a phenomena that some human researchers have likened to the human practice of "trophy spouses." Aberrations to conventional mating behavior,  including the retention of mates for prolonged periods or life and courting and accepting offers of courtship from Pokémon from other lines are occasionally recorded,  though appear to be markedly more common among captive creatures from this line than their wild counterparts.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>Machop eggs appear to have a quality that enables them to survive both ovoviviparous and oviparous reproduction,  not wholly unlike many mammalian Pokemon. The former method is most commonly exhibited amongst wild Machoke and Machamp. The latter most commonly documented among Machop,  captive individuals,  and incidences of multiple offspring. Gender ratios of Machop and its brethren appear to skew male-oriented in both the wild and in captivity,  with observed gender ratios among captive creatures from this line averaging 3 males for every female.
<p></p>Machop are cared for by their mothers for the first 6-10 months of their lives,  and are left to fend for themselves after their muscles develop sufficiently. During these months,  a mother individual from this line will teach her offspring how to hunt,  spar,  and physically train. Unlike some Pokemon in their egg group,  Machop and its evolutions appear to be primarily solitary creatures in their native environments. Individuals do not appear to have intimate social structures,  and beyond mating and childcare behaviors,  only appear to readily interact in groups for purposes of sparring,  training,  or occasionally engaging in group hunts for prey.
<p></p>Creatures from this line appear to also interact with Pokemon outside of their immediate line in some contexts. The most common of these interactions appears to be what appears to be a begrudging respect for Rock-Type Pokemon in their native environs,  which are readily incorporated into these creatures' training regimens both as sparring partners and other forms of training aids such as weights. Creatures from this line also appear to more readily interact with Pokemon exhibiting high degrees of social organization or otherwise potential utility,  one of the most prominent examples being a symbiotic sparring arrangement between young Machop and Cubone in Kanto's Rock Tunnel,  another notable example being the interactions between Machop and Machamp in Unova and local Leavanny.
<p></p><h2> In Human Society</h2>
<p></p>Creatures in the Machop line have long seen employment within human circles,  commonly as bodyguards or as heavy laborers,  roles that they continue to serve regularly in some fields such as mining,  construction,  and private security to this day. Pokemon from this line have long possessed a mixed reputation in human folklore,  with Machop and its brethren often being portrayed as loyal and well-meaning creatures,  but at the same time as being extraordinarily dim-witted and naive. Creatures from this line appear to have left a significant mark on human culture,  including the adoption of martial arts techniques modeled after those utilized by these creatures,  and are a recurring motif in some martial-arts themed media,  including a number of professional sporting leagues and in a <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortalKombat' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortalKombat'>long-running series of fighting games emphasizing gruesome finishing moves.</a>

</div>Well you can always contribute to existing articles... in fact some of them are currently (or always...) being revised<img src="http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/lol2v12_4863.png" alt="[lol]" title="[lol]" height="16" width="16" />
<p></p>More seriously,  back to Jirachi. Wish granting presents a couple (at least) of drastic (at least) issues. Such as stepping on the toes of some weather/timespacecoordinate/sentience Legendaries (at least).
<p></p>If it's true that Jirachi wakes only every X thousand years,  then we have historically very little information about it anyway. Most of it will be lore and rumors of people saying "how the heck could Pokéverse's Nikola Tesla get all those interesting toys? Oh! Let's blame it on Jirachi!" and something like "I asked for light in the dark,  it gave me a laser pointer" turning via oral tradition into "<a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Darkseid' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Darkseid'>YOU DARE CHALLENGE ME,  INSANITY!</a> IMA FAIRIN' MA LEISAR!",  all that sprawled and stretched across <em>hundreds of years</em> in the least. Likewise,  the statements in the canondex about "granting any wish" ought to be taken with the adequate grain of salt. We <em>do</em> know what the canondex says about one too many things.
<p></p>There's also the question,  only tangentially addressed in the movie,  of how free or costly those wishes are. Perhaps it has to remain inactive for X thousand years for a reason,  yes. But then again some idiot <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonBall' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonBall'>wishes for women's underwear</a>...
<p></p>Ugh... I better stop thinking about this.

</div><h1> Marill Line</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalogue #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Azurill [298]
</li><li> Marill [183]
</li><li> Azumarill [184]
</li></ul><p></p><h2> Notable Bio</h2>
<p></p>The Marill Line is a group of gregarious aquatic rodent Pokémon native to the watery environments of the Johto,  Hoenn,  and Sinnoh regions,  as well as the Sevii Islands. The first form,  Azurill,  is a small Pokemon that on average stands at 0.2 meters and weighs only a mere 2 kilograms. They have two small round ears,  blue-black eyes,  white cheek spots reminiscent of those of the <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Pikachu' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Pikachu'>Pikachu Line</a> and their cousins in <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/PlusleAndMinun' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/PlusleAndMinun'>Hoenn</a>,   Sinnoh,  and <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Emolga' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Emolga'>Unova</a>,  and a black tail ending in a blue ball about as large as they are.
<p></p>Azurill are mostly defenseless and are normally never far away from their Marill or Azumarill mothers,  though they do possess a surprising amount of power for a Pokémon of <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse'>their size and evolutionary level</a>,  which remains as the Pokémon. An Azurills tail is the most important part of its body,  as it uses the ball on the end for locomotion,  nutrients,  and as a floatation device. One Azurill was recorded as being able to hurl itself about 33 feet using its tail. This fat and oil filled tail can also be used to lessen the damage caused by extreme heat or cold.  One of their most interesting quirks is the fact that they have a 3:1 ratio of females to males once hatched,  which stabilizes into a 1:1 ratio once they evolve due to <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip'>some of the female Azurill evolving into male Marill.</a> (To be expanded on in Courting and Childrearing.)
<p></p>Azurill evolve through having high levels of a hormone made by making bonds with other creatures. In the wild these bonds are normally made with their parents and siblings. The second form,  Marill,  is also a small,  blue rodent Pokémon that is round in body,  standing at 0.4 meters and weighing about 8.5 kilograms in the average specimen. They have large round ears and a tail just like that of its prevolution,  though the ball at the end is dramatically smaller than that of an Azurills since the fat was eaten up during evolution.
<p></p>A Marills fur is covered in oil that makes it water repellent,  allowing them to always stay dry and conserve heat in cold water. They also use their oil-filled tails as buoys to prevent them from drowning when they go underwater in search of river grasses to eat. The reason why Marill are capable of floating is because the oil inside their tails i less dense than the water outside.
<p></p>Another interesting feature of Marill is their ears,  whose roundness allows them to easily catch sounds in the air. This ability allows them to very easily pick up sounds made by both other Marill and potential predators as they move through their environment,  and is magnified tenfold once the Pokémon is in the water. [[Trainers Note: For this reason Marill and their evolved form,  Azumarill,  are very useful for picking up low frequency sounds.]]
<p></p>After about two months in the wild,  Marill will evolve into their final form,  Azumarill. The average Azumarill stands at about 0.8 meters high and weighs about 28.5 kilograms. As opposed to the circular Marill,  Azumarill are ovoid in shape,  and have very long ears,  giving them leporid as well as rodent features,  and have the smallest tail ball out of all three forms. They have a lower section that is white,  and a white polka dot pattern right above it,  which serves as camouflage while theyre in the water.
<p></p>Azumarills long ears give them even better hearing than that of Marill,  allowing them to hear perfectly even in fast moving rivers and streams,  though this also makes them far more sensitive to damage. To that end,  they are always rolled up whenever the Pokémon decides to go underwater. Their ears are not only good for finding potential prey items,  but also for sensing out potential predators such as Whiscash and Crawdaunt.
<p></p>Another interesting trait about Azumarill is that they are very compassionate towards other creatures. If they see another Pokémon drowning,  they will create pockets of air that will allow them to breathe while they are being pulled up to the surface.
<p></p>Rarely,  there are Azurill born with a green outer coloration and red inner ears. These evolve into Marill with the same coloration and Azumarill with a vibrant golden coloration. Even rarer is a subspecies of Marill with a complete resistance to the attacks commonly used by Grass type Pokémon. Observations of this subspecies show a markedly increased amount of vegetable consumption in the Azumarill stage,  as well as a seeming increase in attack power upon being struck by any technique involving flora.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Marill Line make their homes in riverine environments. While in Johto,  Marill are very rare,  with the only stable population being found within Mt. Mortar,  in Hoenn Marill are among some of the most common Pokémon in their waterways. Sinnohs Marill population is not the largest,  though still larger than Mt. Mortars,  being mainly concentrated in and around Pastorias Great Marsh. The Sevii Island population of Marill is fragmented,  with two populations on Floe and the Ruin Valley of Fortune Island.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Azurill and Marill are herbivorous,  mainly living off of aquatic vegetation,  though the former doesnt eat as much due to their nutrient filled tail. They have a particular love for river grasses. Azumarill on the other hand are omnivorous with a herbivorous slant,  and supplement their diet of vegetation by hunting for prey such as Krabby,  Corphish,  and Barboach by searching them out with their long ears.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>The members of the Marill Line are rather peaceful,  preferring to swim away from a potential threat. However,  like most Pokemon they are capable of fighting back when threatened,  or if their young are threatened. Though Azurill rely mainly on their parents for defense,  if they have to defend themselves they will either blast enemies with jets of water from their underdeveloped swim bladders or slam their very large tails into them,  which can necessitate a trip to the hospital.
<p></p>Marill and Azurill can do the same things Azumarill can,  but can also bowl over enemies by rolling into balls and charging,  doing full body tackles that hurt them as well as their target,  slamming them with their tails while cloaked in water,  firing bigger jets of water from their swim bladders,  using water to heal themselves,  and <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainDance' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainDance'>summoning rainstorms</a> in order to power up any attacks involving water.
<p></p>Another danger that members of the Marill Line can have is that they may have <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength'>problems controlling their own strength</a> and may accidently end up hurting their trainer and others. For this reason it is a good idea for a trainer to properly teach their Marill how to utilize their massive strength without hurting anyone.
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>When it is time to mate,  male older Marill and Azumarill compete against one another in contests of endurance in order to gain breeding rights. These contests can range from swimming races to merely who can keep a rock or Berry up longer using jets of water. After the winning male mates with the female of his choice,  the female Marill or Azumarill will either lay 4-6 eggs or gestate them inside her,  and the baby Azurill are born about a month later. In captivity,  a female Marill or Azumarill will lay Marill eggs instead due to the stress of having to breed outside of their natural environment. [[Trainers Note: If you wish to hatch an Azurill in captivity,  it would be best to give the mother a Sea Incense made from the charred remnants of certain riverside herbs to remind the mother of her home environment,  preventing the laying of Marill eggs instead.]]
<p></p>Once the Azurill are born,  they spend their first few weeks suckling from their mothers teats until theyre old enough to eat solid food. At this point the parents take turns feeding their children while raising them in communal groups with other families,  though as mentioned in Diet they dont require a lot of food due to their nutrient-filled tail.
<p></p>As mentioned in Notable Bio,  the majority of Azurill are born female,  but 1/4th of the female Azurill population will become male upon evolution. The main trigger for this are certain pheromones released in the air in response to the amount of Marill and Azumarill of a certain gender around. These pheromones determine which Azurill will keep their gender and which Azurill will change their gender.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>All members of the Marill Line are gregarious,  being mainly found in groups of up to 20 individuals. The hierarchy is arranged in tiers,  with the Azumarill on top and newly evolved Marill and Azurill on the bottom. The leader Azumarill are the ones who decide where the whole group goes,  and are also the ones who get first pick of any particularly delicious food.
<p></p><h2> In Human Culture</h2>
<p></p>All members of the Marill Line are well known for being regarded as very <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity'>conventionally cute.</a> As a result they tend to be a hit amongst young girls. Due to their ability to make air bubbles,  Azumarill are often used by lifeguards when rescuing people,  and their hearing makes them very useful for fishermen.
<p></p>At one time it was once believed that Marill and its evolutions were closely related to Pikachu and its cousins in other regions,  leading to Marill being called Pikablu in media descriptions. This was later disproven by genetic testing,  and the Marill line was moved to a different genus.

</div>you put that being away from their natural environment causes them to lay Marill eggs due to stress,  and you put that Sea incense is made from riverside grasses and allows them to lay Azuril eggs,  but you never specified that its because the incense reminds them of their natural environment and calms them down.

<p></p>you mean Azuril,  right?

<p></p><h1> Minccino Line++</h1>
<p></p><h2> Morphs [Oak Catalog #]</h2>
<p></p><ul ><li> Minccino (<em>Pulchystricens peregrinocax</em>) [#571]
</li><li> Cinccino (<em>Pulchystricens lautogacaudam</em>) [#572]
</li></ul><p></p>Minccino and Cinccino are small rodent-like Pokémon native to Unova and other nearby regions,  that mostly populate wide grasslands,  sparse forested areas and city suburbs. Wild populations in other regions are being studied at the time of writing of this article; see <a name='Habitat' id='Habitat'></a>,  however.
<p></p>They are relatively small,  averaging less than half a meter in height,  with short arms and legs ended in wide palms. They are easily identifiable because of their gray fur,  long ears and a particularly long and fluffy tail. Both members of this line are covered from top to bottom with short and abundant gray fur that gives them a fuzzy appearance. Thicker fur arranged in scruffs ornaments both their necks and the top of their heads,  while short rows of hairs cover the front of each ear. These short hairs help them verify wind direction to assist their sense of smell.
<p></p>Minccino's tail,  short legs and wide paws provide them with plantigrade locomotion based on dexterity and precision as they hop from tree to tree,  scout the grass and other areas of abundant vegetation,  or furtively dash across fences,  beams and other support elements in sparsely inhabited city suburbs. As they move from place to place,  they show a notable predisposition to cleaning after their trails,  tidying places and moving around or "sorting" small objects.
<p></p>The only spots in Minccino's body not covered by the gray fur are the tips of the ears and tail,  those sporting bright white hair; the purpose of this particular change is not yet known,  but is suspected to be related to identification of blood relatives. Very rare instances of members of this line sporting plum-coloured fur have been observed,  with the tip of the ears and tails covered in lime or thistle-shaded fur instead. This trait does not seem to be hereditary.
<p></p><h2> Notable Biology</h2>
<p></p>One of the most interesting aspects of Minccino biology is their tails. Almost as long as the rest of their bodies are,  not counting the ears,  the Minccino tail is designed to fulfill many biological,  ecological and social roles across the lifetime of a member of this species. The tail itself is comprised of a muscle channel covering the spine,  providing the tail with some flexibility. The spine itself only reaches about 1/3rd of the length of the tail; the rest is backed by longitudinal,  alternating strands of cartilage and  muscle,  each one giving support and mobility to branches of hairs that are organized and behave not unlike the hairs of housebrooms.
<p></p>Stiffening the tip of their tails,  Minccino can use them to drag small objects and particles across the ground,  as well as retrieve nearby objects. Their <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak'>natural tendency to drag around everything they find loose</a> consumes much of their time and defines their level of social interaction; in that sense,  their behaviour at an early age is similar to species such as <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Zigzagoon' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Zigzagoon'>Zigzagoon</a>.
<p></p>Cinccino's tail,  however,  it is not used to drag or broom objects,  but as a protective cover and a symbol of social status for this morph. The tail grows white and fuzzy to about thrice its original size,  and Cinccino make do with it by arranging and wearing it in a manner not unlike how humans wear togas or scarfs,  leading to a component of their name. Trained Cinccino have been shown to be capable of sticking or knotting small shiny objects to their scarfs,  that they wear and display around in a manner not unlike that of military ranking badges.
<p></p><h2> Habitat</h2>
<p></p>Minccino and their evolution are found commonly in certain places in the Unova region. The highest populaton density can be observed in the west side of Unova's central peninsula,  just outside the cities of Opelucid and Nimbasa.
<p></p>While Minccino move around at any time of the day,  Cinccino usually move around their territory only during dawn and dusk,  unless otherwise provoked. The times of the day immediately after their breakfast and the afternoon are spent mostly in continuous revision of their territory,  in search of stuff to tidy up. Were a Minccino or Cinccino to find that their place is tidied up,  they'll climb to a high tree or otherwise look for a vintage point and find a neighbour Minccino with whom to brush tails and tag along for the remainder of the day,  going around in small tasks such as fetching berries,  collecting random objects passerby leave behind,  or practising their aim to fling objects that they don't like or deem usable as means of attacking an intruder or contender.
<p></p>Sometimes,  Minccino and Trubbish's territories or paths cross. While they won't jump at and attack each other,  the presence of both these Pokémon leads to very extroverted and unstable dynamics depending on how populated of random objects is their surrounding space. In general it is recommended to stay away at the sight of Minccino facing Trubbish in suburb areas. See the <a href='#Minccino'>and Trubbish</a> section for more details.
<p></p>At the time of writing of this article,  effort to catalog the habitats and distribution of Minccino populations in regions other than Unova is still underway. While results have been inconclusive,  it can be expected that wild populations would be found in places fitting the overall patterns that this species inhabits in Unova,  that is,  ample grasslands nearby to open,  suburban human settlements. How would this factor in their relationships with species such as Meowth or Murkrow is also under study.
<p></p><h2> Diet</h2>
<p></p>Minccino in the wild are primarily baccivorous,  with a clear preference for dry berries,  although they do fall back to eating grass instead during times of low activity. They can easily get used to human cooking,  in particular when it comes to salads and snacks,  sometimes leading to stray Minccino using their charms or yelling around houses to distract their occupants and thus be able to steal some food.
<p></p>The preference towards dry food is learned and might be related to ease of handling; in fact,  Minccino and Cinccino tend to drink water only at dawn and dusk,  when they have almost no other duties to do in their natural order. Members of this line tend to favour the <em>Chesto Berry</em> which they can be frequently seen carrying around from one hiding spot to the next.
<p></p>Trained Minccino and Cinccino can take another types of food,  showing a preference towards sugars and dried food. They appreciate corn as a treat,  as well as some dry snacks. People who have members of this line as pets,  or as frequent visitors,  will usually see them come for a quick drink for breakfast,  and then make a lunchtime visit to taste whatever the human cook has offered as an entrée.
<p></p>Of note to Trainers,  Minccino seem to consider a sign of disrespect,  or at least of important lack of attention,  to be gifted a berry or an object that they would otherwise eat. For them,  the concepts of "food" and "collectible" are well separated.
<p></p><h2> Hazards</h2>
<p></p>As they are mostly interested in <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak'>keeping their territory perfectly tidy</a> and collecting objects to show around,  Minccino are of no high risk to travellers; those travellers should take care,  however,  to keep their inventory as tidy as the Minccino keep their homes,  and to stay put while traversing wide paths,  otherwise they'll lose any shiny object to a watching Minccino as soon as they pop it out of their pockets or bags.
<p></p>In battle,  Minccino and Cinccino can handle themselves quite efficiently,  despite the first's size and the second's reluctance to battle. Their compact form and dexterity allow them to move around and look for mischievous or surprising ways to attack and opponent. In general,  two "schools" of Minccino battling style can be observed in the wild. The first one has them always keep close to the opponent,  darting and hopping around in a manner that allows them to preserve and build momentum that they carry out from their tree leaps and other maneuvers; this particularly benefit the simplest,  more instinctive patterns of attack such as tackling or scratching,  which they perform with added power at no extra effort expense. The second teaching is similar to patterns exhibited in <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Shellder' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Shellder'>Shellder</a> or <a class='createlink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Aipom' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Aipom'>Aipom</a> attack styles,  where as part of a calmer,  more thought movement,  the Pokémon always follows their opponent and maintains a constantly open vector of attack,  allowing them to consecutively land attacks even as they move or wiggle around.
<p></p>They are also no strangers to unorthodox tactics such as faking tears of fear or disgust,  or charming and tickling their opponents; they mostly use these tactics against other Minccino and rodent-like Pokémon,  as all is fair in the competition for territory,  water,  or that shiny object lying around...
<p></p><h2> Courting and Childrearing</h2>
<p></p>Twice a year,  members of both genders of this line will cross from one neighborhood to the next,  examining all dens in search for the one that both appears the tidiest and most cared for. Females tend to look for mates that appear available to come clean a den at any time,  whereas males tend to look for mates that can clean or collect quickly. The details of the actual breeding process are yet unknown.
<p></p>After eight to ten weeks,  a litter of three or four Minccino is born. The kits grow hair from the lower spine outwards,  and then the paws. At the second week,  all members of the litter accompany their parents in short escapaed to go collect random leaves,  specks or pebbles around their home. Each sibling must maintain a small hoard of his own in a safe spot of their choosing outside of the family den,  and will be forced to leave,  gaining independence,  once he can afford maintaining an habitable resting spot without needing the parents's assistance to sort out or clean the collected objects. This process can last from three to eight months,  depending on the habitat and availability of collectibles.
<p></p><h2> Social Structure</h2>
<p></p>As of this time,  little is known of the way Minccino structure their society. They are known to live in family clusters delimited by landmarks such as trees,  creeks,  stones or fences near human settlements,  delimiting microstructures akin to neighborhoods. Minccino of the same "neighborhood" frequently meet each other,  brush each other's furs and tails,  take communal care of the children,  and share "routes" and "stops" in their travels towards water or food resources.
<p></p>When two Minccino from different neighborhoods meet,  it can be in one of three conditions: looking for objects to collect,  tidying up their personal space,  or just dozing around. If they are competing for objects to collect,  the land "owner" will first warn the intruder,  before chasing him around; very few times these chases end up becoming actual battles,  as both Pokémon try to go <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour'>climb and pass around any feature of the landscape</a> as an attempt to establish their abilities without the need to resorting to mutual damage. If the Minccino are tidying their personal space,  which usually happens in the morning,  both individuals will greet each other in a ritual that consists primarily of smelling each other and brushing each other's tails with their own,  probably to pass to each other olfatory information about what object have they found in their travels.
<p></p>A Minccino that has come into contact with a "Shiny Stone" evolves into Cinccino. These evolved forms rarely travel or explore beyond the confines of their familial unit,  and whenever they can be seen they are usually walking around,  helping their brethren tidy up their territory,  or stand up in a tree or another landmark exhibiting their particular "scarf". The exact meaning of this evolution in their social order is still poorly understood.
<p></p><h2> City Scouting</h2>
<p></p>(Pending in this revision)
<p></p><h2> Interaction with the Trubbish Line</h2>
<p></p>During their exploration of territory,  Minccino can occasionally end up meeting members of the <a class='createlink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Trubbish' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanonPokedex/Trubbish'>Trubbish</a> line,  characterized by their garbage collector habits. They don't actively spread garbage around,  and prefer to incorporate it into their bodies. Because they can compete for random objects for pretty much the same purpose,  both species can come at odds,  however it might be surprising to some that most of the time they do actually work together,  if figuratively baring their teeth the whole time.
<p></p>Minccinos are not too attentive to the presence of a Trubbish until they share a common space where there are objects to collect or tidy up. At this point,  Minccino can't tolerate being around a Trubbish,  as they perceive those as moving blobs of untidy stuff,  and compete for appropriation of dirty objects (one for cleaning,  the other for assimilation); but as time passes Minccino tends to interrupt the Trubbish's activities less as they result in effectively cleaning up the place anyway. In rare circumstances in sparsely populated suburbs,  it can be observed that a Minccino will even help a Trubbish drag,  pull or absorb some small objects so that both species can finish their activities faster; similarly,  Trubbish tend to help brush and sweep dirt out of large objects.
<p></p>In clean environments where a Minccino and a Trubbish meet suddenly,  the Minccino's instincts tend to kick him making him go and try to "clean" the Trubbish,  for the mutual annoyance of both individuals and the amusement of onlookers,  in particular children. Much surprise comes from a Minccino suddenly realizing the mound of dirt he is trying to brush around is alive and demanding to be let go.
<p></p><h2> <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherWiki' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherWiki'>In Popular Culture</a></h2>
<p></p>Minccino have been known for their collection and hygiene habits for a relatively long period of time. The fact that they build up habits from a early age and trade on them on the same level as humans do on currency,  added to their playfulness and the lack of inherent risks in letting them live in-house,  have led to them being considered good house companions for families with young children. This leads to several Minccino facets present in advertising,  the most prominent of them a series of commercials advertising bleach,  surface cleaners and Skitty litters,  featuring Minccino paws popping out from below or behind random objects (such as the TV set,  a lamp,  a salad bowl and even a sleeping Purugly) <a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak'>to stealthily and insistently clean the surrounding surfaces</a>.
<p></p>Unfortunately this trait has been over-exaggerated by the media as well,  leading to a trend that lasted for some years,  where mothers and housewives that had to spent most of their time at home,  doing chores,  were despectively described as having the "''<a class='twikilink' href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct' title='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct'>Minccinrox</a> Syndrome",  after a renowned brand of such products as mentioned above.

</div>The Machop article looks fine to me.
<p></p>"<em>Pokémon of their size and evolutionary level,  which remains as the Pokémon. An Azurills tail</em>"
In the Marill line article,  this sentence seems to suddenly end and doesn't flow right,  but apart from that it's good.
<p></p>With the Minccino article,  you should probably mention that the ones that can consecutively land hits are significantly rarer (Skill Link is from the Dream World),  and that there's a variant which is exceptionally good at causing others to lower their guard and not want to harm them in exchange for not having the technical skill showed by the other two variants (you mentioned they use underhanded tactics,  but some of them do get Cute Charm).  Though you are going to be adding more to it later,  I think Cinccino should get a bit more mention - it becomes capable of learning several multi-strike moves (Bullet Seed and Rock Blast) upon evolving,  so it can probably throw or launch objects much better than Minccino can.  Apart from that it looks good.
<p></p>I'll call dibs on the Geodude line,  I think.
