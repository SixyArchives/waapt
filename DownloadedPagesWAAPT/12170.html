<p></p><h3>Pyrite Town,  Abandoned Warehouse</h3>
<p></p>-Herbert bursts into the warehouse,  glancing around the darkened building whilst brandishing Tsumigari.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Sakura? Damnit,  I wasn't planning on a hostage situation...
<p></p>-He attempts to use his Aura Sense to peer through the gloom and step forward cautiously,  keeping an eye out for Alexia.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Sakura,  where are you? Can you hear me? Are you alright?
<p></p>-Herbert then notices his Aura Sense failing,  and is soon unable to feel anything else.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Herbert!
<p></p>-Sakura then runs towards Herbert,  looking at her direction would also reveal Alexia there,  standing as if she had been hit on the side.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> I managed to get away from her,  is that the girl you told me about?
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> ...Yeah. Yeah,  that's her.
<p></p>-He turns to face Alexia with a hard,  set expression,  though he doesn't bother pointing his sword at her and instead places his free hand on his Pokeballs.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> You again. What do you want from us this time? Come to reduce Sakura to a bloody mess instead of me,  huh? Out on another snagging trip? Or are you just trying to lure us into some sort of trap?
<p></p>-Alexia,  as usual,  remains in silence and just reaches for an Ultra Ball she was carrying with her,  releasing Shadow!Duke. Sakura suddenly gets wide-eyed with a very shocked expression on her face and shaking.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> W-What is this...? These feelings...!
<p></p>-Herbert flinches slightly upon seeing Duke again,  but closes his eyes,  takes a deep breath,  and steels himself. He then turns back to Sakura,  only opening his eyes once Duke is out of sight.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> What are you going on about?
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> The feelings I'm getting from him and her... So much anger,  sorrow,  remorse... I cant deal with all of this! -starts tearing up-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> -smiling excitedly- &lt;Hahah! The kid got back with a friend this time? Good,  I wouldn't be able to rest peacefully if I didn't finish what I started.&gt;
<p></p>-Herbert does his best to ignore Duke,  still focused on Sakura.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Are you kidding me? Of all the times to have an emotional breakdown,  you choose <em>now?</em> We're fighting a pair of merciless sadists and suddenly you're overwhelmed by pains of sorrow? Snap out of it,  damnit!
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> -crying and looking quite pained- You don't understand,  these feelings are just too powerful for me to handle...
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> &lt;Well then,  allow me to end your suffering.&gt;
<p></p>-Shadow!Duke then starts charging up an Aura Sphere. Herbert gives an exasperated sigh,  then turns to face Alexia again,  hand still on his Pokeballs.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Fine then. Looks like I'm going to have to do this myself,  as always. Falchion,  you're up first!
<p></p>-He sends out Falchion,  who takes one look at Duke before turning back to Herbert.-
<p></p><strong>Falchion:</strong> &lt;...Seriously? You're trying this again after what happened last time?&gt;
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Just stick to the plan,  and we'll be fine! Now Brick Break!
<p></p>-Falchion groans,  then charges at Duke with a karate chop. Seeing the attack coming,  Duke just chooses to fire the Aura Sphere at him while he's coming.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> S-Sorry... I-I'm so sorry...
<p></p>-As he charges,  Falchion is hit by the Aura Sphere,  but...-
<p></p><center><span class="asscaps" >Falchion held on thanks to his Focus Sash!</span></center>
<p></p><strong>Falchion:</strong> &lt;<span style='font-size:83.3%'>Urgh... this is revenge for the dress thing,  isn't it?</span>&gt;
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Maybe. Now press the attack!
<p></p>-Falchion finishes his charge and chops at Duke,  whilst Herbert turns back to Alexia,  without attempting to attack and seemingly trying to ignore Duke.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> You know,  I've been thinking about you a lot since our last two encounters. Not,  like,  in <em>that</em> way,  though. Dear Arceus,  no. No,  I was more curious than anything.
<p></p>-Duke is caught off-guard by the usage of the Focus Sash and is hit,  though he's quick to retaliate with a Brick Break of his own. Sakura then starts to endure the feelings she's getting a bit better,  though the emotional response that happens after each painful hit isn't helping much-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> W-What do you mean by that?
<p></p>-Alexia is completely silent,  as usual. Falchion is struck by the Brick Break and knocked unconscious,  but barely even has time to hit the floor before Herbert recalls him and sends out Harkness in his place,  not even looking at the fight.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Harkness,  you know the plan.
<p></p><strong>Harkness:</strong> &lt;That I do!&gt;
<p></p>-He darts at Duke with a Flame Charge,  whilst Herbert ignores Sakura and focuses all of his attention on Alexia.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> I was curious because I knew I'd have to fight you again at some point. Call it a gut feeling. Or maybe it was because I was determined to hunt you down and kick your teeth in for stealing my locket and trying to snag Bishop. Either way,  I knew that if I wanted to win this third battle,  I'd have to reflect carefully on our first two.
<p></p>-Duke quickly dodges the Flame Charge by leaping out of the way and trying to get a reasonable distance away from the Monferno-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> &lt;You again,  you're not even fully evolved and think you can take me on? How cute.&gt;
<p></p>-Duke then gives a hard punch on the ground,  shaking the entire warehouse with an Earthquake,  Alexia just keeps staring at Herbert while trying to keep her balance. Harkness is knocked out virtually instantly by the tremors,  which causes Herbert to scowl as he recalls the Monferno.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Okay,  that wasn't part of the plan. Doesn't matter. Looks like I'll just have to accelerate things.
<p></p>-He sends out Revan,  who throws up his arms to generate a Trick Room,  never once taking his eyes off of Alexia.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Of course,  knowing your enemy is the first rule of battle. So I figured I'd think over our first battle and see what it told me about your tactics. But I soon realised that a single battle wasn't going to tell me anything. Unless I figured out what made you tick,  that is.
<p></p>-Duke then becomes much slower and decides to resort to keeping a distance away from Revan by firing a Shadow Storm at him-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> -smiling- &lt;So you're here again,  this time I won't let you run away.&gt;
<p></p>-Revan,  taking advantage of his significantly increased speed,  darts out of the way of the Shadow Storm and glares at Duke.-
<p></p><strong>Revan:</strong> &lt;You only retreat after you've <em>lost</em> a battle,  moron. And there's no way we're going to lose to an idiotic creep like you again.&gt;
<p></p>-He darts at Duke with a Fire Punch. Herbert,  meanwhile,  has all but abandoned directing the battle in favour of focusing on Alexia.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> You know,  at first I thought you might be a fairly decent person. The kind that just happened to be working for the wrong side,  the kind who you'd like to get to know better if you weren't trying to kill each other. That probably came across during our first confrontation. Of course,  now I know better.
<p></p>-Duke is hit by the Fire Punch,  being unable to move out of the way in time and staggers after it,  looking quite damaged by it in fact-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> &lt;You... This damned Trick Room is getting in my way...&gt;
<p></p>-Alexia visibly clenches her hand in response to Herbert,  but says nothing and does nothing else-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> -smiles again- &lt;No matter,  there's no excitement if things just go the way we want all the time is there? It's fun to ruin other's hope isn't it? Like I'm going to do with your hope of winning.&gt;
<p></p>-Duke then starts charging some energy and instead of firing it at Revan,  he instead decides to fire it at as a Dark Pulse at the oblivious Herbert.-
<p></p><strong>Revan:</strong> &lt;Herbert!&gt;
<p></p>-Herbert spins around,  caught off-guard,  but before the blast can hit him Revan darts in front of the attack and tanks the blow.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Thanks,  Revan!
<p></p><strong>Revan:</strong> &lt;Oh,  gee,  <em>now</em> you remember to thank me. Guess I just wasn't pulling my weight last time,  huh?&gt;
<p></p>-Revan turns back to Duke and slams his fist into the ground,  generating another Earthquake. As he struggles to maintain his footing,  he smirks at Alexia despite himself.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Finally getting through to whatever's under that mask,  am I? Good. But yes,  for a time I deluded myself into thinking you could be reasoned with. That changed about halfway through our first meeting. You'd won,  after all. You could've just walked away,  job done. But no,  you weren't satisfied until I was lying broken on the ground bleeding out of orifices I didn't even know I had. You just sat and watched the carnage like the sadist you are,  just waiting for me to scream. That's when I realised that you're just as much of a monster as your boss,  if not worse. You don't need to say anything for me to figure that out. And you know what? I don't think that's the worst of it.
<p></p>-Duke is hit by the Earthquake and is now barely holding his own in battle-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> &lt;U-Ugh... Heheheh,  that's it then? Now it's just a matter of seeing who can endure more pain isn't it? Well then,  let's see how much you can take!&gt;
<p></p>-Duke then attempts to hit Herbert with a Shadow Storm,  Sakura,  meanwhile,  is just watching the battle unfold-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> <span style='font-size:69.4%'>Duke... What did they do to you...?</span>
<p></p>-Revan is caught in the spread of the Shadow Storm,  as is Herbert. Revan is rendered unconscious almost instantly,  whilst Herbert is knocked off of his feet and slammed against a nearby cargo container,  Tsumigari flying out of his hand.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Herbert!
<p></p>-Herbert lies still for a couple of seconds,  before lifting his head back up,  Sakura running over to help him to his feet.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>I'm not... finished yet...</span>
<p></p>-He recalls Revan,  and sends out Bishop in his place. The Scizor looks from Herbert,  to Duke,  then back at his trainer,  visibly shaking.-
<p></p><strong>Bishop:</strong> &lt;...These two again&gt;
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> You ready for this,  Bishop?
<p></p><strong>Bishop:</strong> &lt;...I provided that they do not attempt another snagging,  I think I should be fine....&gt;
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Good. Thanks,  Bishop now,  let's finish this.
<p></p>-Bishop charges at Duke with a Brick Break,  whilst Herbert heaves himself to his feet and looks back at Alexia with a steely glare.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Still not trying to defend yourself,  huh? Didn't think you would. Because on top of everything else,  you're a coward. You hide behind a mask and an alias,  too scared to look your victims in the eyes for fear of their retribution. You don't have the guts to face up to the consequences of everything you've done. You kind of people make me sick. Well,  guess what? You won't be able to hide for much longer. We've got you cornered like the rat you are.
<p></p>-Duke then parries Bishop's move with a Brick Break of his own,  looking at the Scizor with a psychopathic smile-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> &lt;I see you grew a backbone and evolved,  but you still think you're a match for me? This time I dont have to keep you alive.&gt;
<p></p>-Bishop forces himself to look at his opponent as he retaliates by delivering an Aerial Ace across Duke's snout.-
<p></p><strong>Bishop:</strong> &lt;Perhaps not. But you seek to do my trainer harm,  and I cannot allow that whilst I am still capable of fighting. Melodramatic,  perhaps,  but it is the truth.&gt;
<p></p>-Duke blocks the Aerial Ace with his other arm,  though it did hurt quite a bit to do it. He then leaps backwards to get some distance from him-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> -grinning- &lt;Defiant to the end,  I can appreciate that.&gt;
<p></p>-Duke then takes some impulse and rushes at Bishop with a strong dark aura surrounding him-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> -looking at Alexia- <em>Why am I getting those feelings from her? It doesn't match up with what Herbert told me about her at all...</em>
<p></p>-Bishop throws up an x-shaped block with his claws and attempts to tank Duke's attack,  though he is clearly drained and battered by the effort.-
<p></p><strong>Bishop:</strong> &lt;My surrender here would mean condemning you to your current state for what may well be the remainder of your life. I cannot allow myself to give in or be defeated... to consign you to the same fate that I myself once suffered. The fate that I almost suffered again at your hands.&gt;
<p></p>-He takes advantage of Duke's close proximity to deliver another Brick Break in retaliation and it hits,  the impact of the move pushing Duke away a bit and putting a decent distance between them,  though he soon kneels down on the ground-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> &lt;Damnit...! This shouldn't be happening...!&gt;
<p></p>-He then gets up and fires a Shadow Storm at Bishop,  now preferring to keep a good distance from him. Bishop is buffeted by the storm,  his knees buckling as the darkness rushes over him.-
<p></p><strong>Bishop:</strong> <em>Urgh... no,  I cannot afford to relapse here... not when the battle is this close,  when everything comes down to me winning in the end,  when we cannot afford to lose...</em>
<p></p>-Weakened,  but still standing,  he takes off and flies through the storm to slam into Duke with Acrobatics. Not even acknowledging that it would even be possible to go through it,  Duke is caught off-guard and sent flying against a nearby wall,  he then collapses on the ground,  with no energy to even get up-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> &lt;H-How did you... Ugh... I was too careless...&gt;
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Is it over?
<p></p>-Herbert breaks eye contact with Alexia for a moment to glance over at the site of Bishop and Duke's battle. Bishop slumps to his knees,  exhausted,  but still capable of fighting.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> ...No. Not yet.
<p></p>-He bends over to pick up Tsumigari with his right hand,  whilst rummaging around in his bag and producing a Master Ball with his left. He points the former at Alexia and the latter at Duke.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Before I actually do the honours,  though... let's see if there's a pretty face hiding beneath that mask,  shall we?
<p></p>-Alexia remains motionless,  still staring at Herbert,  before giving a small,  sad chuckle.-
<p></p><strong>Alexia:</strong> ...Heh...
<p></p>-Herbert tilts his head at her.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Wait,  you're suddenly talking now?
<p></p><strong>Alexia:</strong> ...Yeah... there's something I need to say to you,  after all...
<p></p>-She puts a hand up to her mask,  then pulls it off,  managing a small smile despite her expression of overwhelming regret.-

<p></p><h2> AU Icirrus</h2>
<p></p>Del wanders the newly set up baazaar,  talking with the locals.
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Humon!Croagunk:</strong> Thank you! Come again!&gt;
<p></p>&lt;Sure,  sure!&gt;
<p></p>He continues on,  walking down the street.
<p></p>&lt;Hmm. Nice town.&gt;
<p></p>-It is at this point that the sight of a Sableye lugging a blade larger than its body attracts the attention of a couple mons less-than-enthused to have to be in town-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> ... What?&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> ... *sigh* Come on,  lets just make sure that its not a present danger to anyone who *ought* to be here.&gt;
<p></p>-And causes the two to draw near the Sableye,  one of the Druddigon accosting in a suspicious tone-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> ... Erm Care to explain just *what* youre doing with that? We dont exactly see too many mons from here lugging around blades Or refugees lugging around blades for that matter.&gt;
<p></p>&lt;Who,  me? Oh! Right. Im the Commander of the Celestial Army. Yknow,  your neighbors?&gt;
<p></p>Del smiles at the Druddigons,  humming to himself.
<p></p>-The two Druddigon look at each other-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Has he been drinking that bitter water that humans seem to like? He doesnt exactly seem Lucid.</span>&gt; o_ó
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>... I was aware that this army was supposed to be rag-tag But surely theyre more professional than <em>this</em>...</span>&gt; o_ó
<p></p>-The two pause for a moment-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>I dunno,  maybe we should tell him to take a hike.</span>&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Lets see what he wants,  first...</span> I Er See And What pray tell,  does this Celestial Army want?&gt;
<p></p>Del smiles again,  disarmingly.
<p></p>&lt;Im here to see the wizard!&gt;
<p></p>-Which elicits a pair of figurative sweatdrops from the pair-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> Um Right Wizard...&gt; -_-;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Lords Reshiram and Zekrom cant possibly be interested in <strong>this</strong>...</span>&gt; &gt;_&gt;;
<p></p>-Which gives the two pause,  as they reflect on a certain grievous misreading of their patrons intents a few seasons ago-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> But If he <em>is</em> somehow supposed to go before them What would they think if they found out?&gt; ._.
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> If he <em>isnt</em>,  do you think thats gonna turn out any better?&gt;
<p></p>-The two look at each other,  and gulp-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>If he <em>isnt</em> supposed to visit them,  we say that he held us at swordpoint?</span>&gt; ._.;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Um Yeah Lets go with that</span>&gt; ._.;
<p></p>-To Del-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> Er We can take you to this Uhm Wizard... <span style='font-size:83.3%'>By Reshiram,  that felt so sacreligious.</span> We cant promise you that the wizard will have time to hear you,  though.&gt; -_-;
<p></p>&lt;Oh,  no worries,  no worries. Just get me to the boss,  and well all be happy,  eh?&gt;
<p></p><h2> About an Hour Later - Grand Chamber of Dragonspiral Tower</h2>
<p></p>-A certain duo are flying in from opposing directions Having spent the day helping out with keeping various parts of Icirrus semi-running-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> *sigh* I see why humans preferred to leave this work to machines.&gt; -_-;
<p></p>-Which elicits a concerned look from a nearby Golurk-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Golurk:</strong> ... They are not overworking you,  are they,  my lords? If they are,  surely you could just let your wishes be known and your vassals would acquiesce&gt; ._.;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> *sigh* Its fine If we cant help fix things the way we *want*,  we can at least help fix them *this* way&gt;
<p></p>Del walks into the main chamber.
<p></p>&lt;Hello! Long day at work,  I see.&gt;
<p></p>-The sound catches the attention of two legendaries,  who turn their heads-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> ... Eh?&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Who is this?&gt;
<p></p>-And notice a Sableye,  with some rather embarrassed-looking Druddigon right beside it-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>What are you *doing*?! Wait until you have been summoned to speak!</span>&gt; O_O;
<p></p>&lt;Sorry,  sorry,  never been one for ceremony!&gt;
<p></p>He waves.
<p></p>&lt;Evening,  sir,  madame. I am General Delta,  Commander of the Celestial Army. And Ive come to speak with you. Specifically you,  my dear sir!&gt;
<p></p>He smiles innocently.
<p></p>&lt;A question,  in fact.&gt;
<p></p>-Inquisitively,  a bit put off by the boldness of the little imp,  but wanting to hear more-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> ... Oh?&gt;
<p></p>&lt;Indeed. Let me ask you,  first,  are you not the Dragon of Ideals?&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> I am,  yes&gt;
<p></p>&lt;Then why,  pray tell,  are you not out there,  on the front lines? Why are you not out there,  defending the spirit of the law,  and not the letter? WHY ARE YOU NOT OUT THERE,  BEING WHO YOU ARE? Does justice mean nothing to you? Are you truly who you say you are? Because from what I see,  sir,  you are not. You are in here,  caring for the refugees,  as if that excuses you from doing your duty! You are the Dragon of Ideals! WHY DONT YOU ACT LIKE IT?!&gt;
<p></p>-Growling,  clearly not terribly thrilled to hear the outburst-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Why I <em>never!</em>&gt;
<p></p>-It is at this,  that a certain duo,  now stammering rather nervously,  wrestle the Sableye to the ground-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> O-Our apologies,  my lords! This i-is all a case of mistaken identity!&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> Y-Yeah,  the little miscreant will be leaving r-right this minute!&gt;
<p></p>-Growling under breath-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>You little idiot! Of all the ways to blow things up in our faces like that,  you chose <em>sacrilege?!</em></span>&gt;
<p></p>-In a voice with a hint of aggravation-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> ... Let him up.&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> H-Huh? B-But,  we c-can handle th-&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> That wasnt a suggestion!&gt; &gt;:(
<p></p>-And the two recoil,  and hastily unhand the Sableye,  starting to plead with the surely upset Taos-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> P-Please! W-We didnt know that he was going to do th-this!&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> Y-Yeah! H-He claimed to be the l-leader of an army! A-And we just wanted to make sure-!&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Enough I wish to have words with the little one Im sure that he is surely not the only mon who wants an explanation of all of this&gt;
<p></p>-To the Sableye,  with a resigned,  if seemingly more displeased with the matter of things that he is beginning to explain than the earlier outburst-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> To answer your question,  Im not out there right now because of laws that I and my peers are beholden to in order to allow the normal order of things on this world to progress&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Unfortunately If theres one thing that weve had hammered into our heads by the others during our existence Its that this world is a little Fragile when we use our power.&gt; &gt;_&gt;;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> I dont approve of it But,  Im afraid that our claws are truly tied here for now Short of mounting insubordination to the Thousand-Armed One.&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> For the record,  the *last* time we ignored his boundaries,  we became rather drowsy afterwards It took about Oh 2 millennia for that to sort itself out.&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Hey,  if it werent for having to do paperwork for Cresselia in the Dream World during all of that,  it would have been alright!</span>&gt; &gt;_&gt;;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Oh,  and most of Unova was destroyed in the process.</span> BUT. That should help elaborate as to *why* you have not seen us,  yes?&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Our <em>original</em> idea was to skirt this by having our guards take to battle on our behest,  but&gt;
<p></p>-And looks at a certain duo that are rather pallid and visibly trembling-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> W-Wait,  m-my Lord,  p-please! W-Were trying to fix that!&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> W-Were not t-trying to m-make you upset! Pl-Please dont kill us!&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> ... What? I was just going to say that you all had your claws full!&gt; ._.;
<p></p>-Still stammering-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #1:</strong> O-Oh! Y-You were! I m-mean,  o-of course you were! W-We wouldnt be so bl-blind as to your intent!&gt;
<p></p>-Facepalming-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> *sigh* I think that things are fine,  you two Surely you could find something to keep yourselves busy with the other guards?&gt;
<p></p>-A touch overeagerly-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Druddigon #2:</strong> Y-Yes my Lords,  r-right away!&gt;
<p></p>-And the two hastily leave the room,  one of the two clipping the door arch and yelping a bit on the way out-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Zekrom,  shouldnt we be the least bit *concerned* about that display?</span>&gt;
<p></p>-To Reshiram before turning over to the Sableye-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Its something to keep in mind,  I guess</span> So Yeah. Thats why I havent been able to help much beyond around here.&gt;
<p></p>Del paces,  thinking.
<p></p>&lt;Reason and logic are all fine and good,  but this is different! This is the real world! Furthermore,  it sets a bad legal precedent! Think,  man! If this is allowed,  what else might they do next? How far will you let them go? This is no time for rational,  cool,  detached thought! This is a time to help! A time to wage battle and restore what should be!&gt;
<p></p>He spins,  and points at the two.
<p></p>&lt;And for that matter,  what measure is a human? Just because their bodies have been changed,  does that mean their very being is changed? NO! NOT AT ALL! The Vow still applies,  and what the Draconic Empire has done is wrong!&gt;
<p></p>As Del continues,  his tone gets more and more accusatory.
<p></p>-Glowering,  both figuratively and literally-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Ive never seen such a disgraceful display in my life! Did you not *listen* to anything we just told you?! Get OU-!&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> A moment,  Reshiram.&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Eh?! What?!&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Look Weve already told you that we kinda have a divine llama breathing down our necks about this matter But Your ideals are strong And they would surely move my heros heart were he here to fight these miscreants&gt;
<p></p>-Pausing a bit,  before continuing-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> But unfortunately,  he isnt So I guess what Im getting at here is
<p></p>There *is* perhaps a way that we can get one past the Great One that we still have at our disposal&gt;
<p></p>-Starting to look concerned-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Zekrom What Are you proposing?&gt; ._.;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Its simple,  is it not? The Vow ties our claws from intervening in affairs between mons But&gt;
<p></p>-With a small smirk-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> It says nothing about giving a gift or two to our servants and their allies&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Zekrom,  you cant seriously be suggesting-! Those are supposed to be <em>rewards for service!</em> Thats just another headache waiting to happen! And of all possible mons to bestow that upon,  you choose this little-!&gt; O_o;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Enough Im not asking *you* to do this,  *Ill* do it myself. <span style='font-size:83.3%'>Besides,  our outstanding reward for this is for keeping pizza on the menu!</span>&gt;
<p></p>-To Del-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Im sure that its not quite what youd like,  but Surely its better than nothing?&gt;
<p></p>Del stands,  thinking.
<p></p>&lt;... Very well. It shall serve,  if that is the best that can be done.&gt;
<p></p>-Extending a claw-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Zekrom But he hasnt <em>earned</em> this yet! What sort of precedent are we setting here?!&gt; O_o;
<p></p>-Pausing in order to give a stern warning-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Given the Erm Extenuating circumstances of this A brief disclaimer
<p></p>This is not a <em>gift</em>,  but a <em>loan</em>. When things return to something a bit closer to normalcy,  then it will be decided as to whether or not you have earned the right to continue to bear what you are about to receive
And if we find that youve been misusing it,  we can call in that loan a bit early.
<p></p>Are we clear?&gt; &gt;:|
<p></p>&lt;Aye.&gt;
<p></p>Del steps forward.
<p></p>&lt;Shall I say a few words,  first? It feels only right.&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> ... Go ahead.&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>This I choose to do. If there is a price,  this I choose to pay. If it is my death,  then I choose to die. Where this takes me,  there I choose to go. I choose. This I choose to do.</strong>&gt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Very well,  then let this power aid you in your fight!&gt;
<p></p>-And light envelops the Sableye,  as strange markings begin to sprout on its hide-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> Go forth and lead your army to victory. Let their cleverness not allow them to elude our disapproval of their misdeeds.
<p></p>And For our part,  well try and see if we can sneak our proposal to nix this idiotic clause a few hundred thousand places up the pile of paperwork when no ones looking.&gt;
<p></p>Del flexes his hands,  working them.
<p></p>&lt;Aye. They shall not stand.&gt;
<p></p>He turns to leave.
<p></p>&lt;And as a reminder to always be true to yourself,  and your duty as a veritable god in these lands&gt;
<p></p>He takes his sword,  and stabs it into one of the pillars.
<p></p>&lt;Good day. I have more respect for you than I did before.&gt;
<p></p>He departs.
<p></p>-A random Golett watches the Sableye stab the pillar on his way out-
<p></p>&lt;<strong>DST!Golett:</strong> I spent all day yesterday filling in cracks on that pillar&gt; D8
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Zekrom Are you *sure* that was a good idea?&gt; &gt;.&lt;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Zekrom:</strong> ... Like I said,  its a <em>loan</em>... <span style='font-size:83.3%'>And surely those ideals keep him from being TOO much of a loose cannon</span>
<p></p><span style='font-size:83.3%'>I hope.</span>&gt; ._.;
<p></p>&lt;<strong>Reshiram:</strong> Oh. And next time,  meet him OUTSIDE the tower.&gt; &gt;.&lt;

</div><h2>Pyrite Town - Abandoned Warehouse</h2>
<p></p>-Tsumigari drops from Herbert's hand with a loud clatter.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> ...
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> S-Si-S-Sis...?! You...! You...! -too shocked to say anything else-
<p></p><strong>Bishop:</strong> &lt;...Well,  it appears that my initial assessment was correct. Though perhaps not in the manner which I had anticipated.&gt;
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> You hate me now,  don't you? Both of you,  after all,  I'm nothing but a traitor.
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> S-Sis... Why? Why did you-
<p></p>-Herbert cuts Sakura off by closing the distance between him and Lyuri in two steps and punching her straight in the bridge of her nose. As she recoils,  he wraps both his hands around her throat.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Too <em>fucking</em> right. Don't you <em>dare</em> say another word,  you traitorous <em>bitch.</em>
<p></p>-His grip tightens. In the meantime,  the exhausted Duke is just watching the scene unfold with a shocked expression,  whilst Bishop seizes up,  suddenly conflicted.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> HERBERT! Stop! You're going to kill her!
<p></p>-Lyuri was,  of course,  unable to do anything about it while Sakura was desperately trying to get separate the two of them. Her attempts are futile,  as Herbert shoves her away before wrapping both his hands around Lyuri's neck again.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Good.
<p></p>-He gives a guttural snarl.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> This is how you pay us back,  huh? After everything we've done for you,  the lengths we've gone to rescue Duke in order to get you to quit whining about your lost obsession and go back to being a productive member of society,  you go out and try to sabotage our efforts at every turn? You decided to just sit back and <em>let</em> Alexiel do this to Duke? I guess your precious boyfriend wasn't precious enough to warrant you <em>actually trying to help him</em> whilst he's having his memories torn out and his mind brutalised,  was he?
<p></p>-He stamps on her foot to vent his pent-up anger and adrenaline as he tightens his grip on her neck again.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Then again,  I guess you weren't even trying to help him in the first place,  considering that you <em>fucking betrayed us.</em> Hell,  maybe that was your sick,  twisted fantasy all along - to have your boyfriend tortured until he couldn't even remember his own name whilst you just sat back and enjoyed the show. I bet the only thing that even came <em>close</em> to being as enjoyable for you was when you got to use said brainwashed boyfriend to beat me until I pissed blood,  right? When you snagged my closest companion and laughed at my helplessness? Tell me,  did you have to torture anyone <em>else</em> to get your job,  or did Alexiel nominate you as his second the moment he saw how eager you were to mentally mutilate the person who you supposedly cared for?
<p></p>-Herbert then might notice a gun being pointed at his head. Bishop freezes,  torn between whether or not to intervene and if so,  on whose side.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> -her expression being as dark as it could be- Let her go. <strong>Now</strong>.
<p></p>-Herbert pales,  but doesn't loosen his grip.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> ...You wouldn't.
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> At the moment what I'm seeing is someone attempting to kill my sister in cold blood. You think I wouldn't?
<p></p>-There is a long pause,  before Herbert finally releases Lyuri and roughly kicks her away in one movement.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> ...Fine. I wasn't planning on killing her,  anyway. You want to hear what kind of miserable drivel she'll spew in her defense? Be my guest.
<p></p>-Lyuri falls to the ground,  struggling to catch her breath,  she then stays on her knees,  crying. Sakura then looks from her to Herbert,  the look she was giving him being extremely icy.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> I don't know her reasons,  I don't what's going on here,  but what I'm <strong>NOT</strong> going to tolerate is you insulting my sister as if you knew everything about her,  you know <strong>NOTHING</strong> about her at all and if you think you have any right to be assaulting her for what happened,  you <strong>DON'T</strong>. Lyuri is wrong about what she did,  but you're not better <strong>in the least</strong> for acting the way you did!
<p></p>-Herbert takes a couple of steps backwards,  temporarily overwhelmed by Sakura's anger,  but then he starts forward again with a renewed surge of rage. Bishop staggers to his feet in the background,  completely helpless about how to react to the argument breaking out in front of him.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Oh yeah? You think I'm worse than the girl who used her own boyfriend as a mindless instrument of murder,  do you? Did your moral compass get caught in a magnetic storm back in Holon or something? The whole reason I came to Orre and started fighting Cipher in the first place was to <strong>help</strong> your traitorous wretch of a sister! It's easy for you to sit back there and defend her when she never had a Shadow mon beat you and your team to within an inch of your life whilst she just sat there and <strong>FUCKING WATCHED!</strong>
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> Sakura... Stop... I deserve all of this.
<p></p>-Sakura then turns to Lyuri,  her feelings of sorrow and pain despair being similar to the one she herself was feeling not too long ago-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> S-Sis... Why...?
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> -breaking down in tears- It doesn't matter. I'm an idiot who can't do anything but hurt the ones I care the most even when I'm trying to help. I couldn't do anything to help our parents when that cave-in happened,  I didn't do anything for you once you were thrown at the world all alone,  I only made the situation at the Indigo League with Jacob worse by trying to protect you,  everything I did in Unova was just a big chain of mistakes one after another where I just kept hurting everyone... I can't do anything even for my own boyfriend. If... If the only thing I'm good for is hurting others... Then whats my purpose?
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> -about to start crying as well- S-Sis... Please... Please don't say that...
<p></p>-Herbert blinks at Lyuri and pauses for a second,  but any sympathy is quickly buried beneath another surge of rage.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> That's a pretty damn good question,  if you ask me! Are you really still trying to pull the "I was just trying to help" card? You seriously think I'm going to believe that shit? Yeah,  because beating the everloving crap out of me proved to be really fucking conducive to Duke's rescue in the long run! Any chance you had of convincing me that you're just out to help people disappeared when you started working as a Cipher Admin's right-hand psycho!
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> -still crying a lot and sobbing- It did... It really... Did. Didn't it?
<p></p>-Sakura turns to Herbert again,  shaking with rage,  but not to the point of pointing the gun at him again-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> -crying as well- SHUT UP! I... I can't believe you! You don't even know what could've happened during this entire time in which we haven't seen her and even then you didn't hesitate in the least to try and kill the only close relative I still have left! I hate you! Dont ever come across me or my sister again!
<p></p>-Herbert then notices Duke,  who started to get up again,  his expression being similar to the one Sakura had just a few minutes ago as she pointed the gun at him,  it almost seemed like he had completely healed himself from all the damage he took.-
<p></p><strong>Shadow!Duke:</strong> &lt;Y-You...!&gt;
<p></p>-He then rushes at Herbert with a Shadow Break that seemed even stronger than normal-
<p></p><strong>Bishop:</strong> &lt;NO!&gt;
<p></p>-Bishop,  still watching the scene in quiet horror,  darts forward and intercepts the Shadow Break,  getting himself knocked out almost instantly. Herbert quickly wheels round to face Duke,  Bishop's intervention having brought him a couple of seconds.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Arceusdamnit... you stay out of this! She's the one that did all of this to you in the first place!
<p></p>-He snatches up the Master Ball which he dropped along with Tsumigari,  clips it into his Snag Machine,  then hurls it at Duke. It hits him and he's sucked inside,  getting captured without any extra struggles. The moment he is captured,  however,  a voice calls out.-
<p></p><strong>???:</strong> Nonononono... You're going completely out of the script,  stop improvising!
<p></p>-It's then that suddenly a Zoroark appears and pins Herbert on the ground at the same time that a Bisharp appears and quickly takes Sakura hostage by keeping one of his blades next to her neck-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Not this again...
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Argh! What the... gerrof!
<p></p>-Herbert attempts to wrestle the Zoroark off of him,  but his inability to use Force Palm means that his attempts are futile. Alexiel then walks in the scene and passes by Lyuri,  who doesn't even make any effort to stop him as he goes to Herbert's Master Ball and picks it up-
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> Ah,  Alexia,  I thought we could make a good duo if you weren't so foolish as to try to outsmart me again and escape with your precious boyfriend. Things could've gone better if you had followed my orders to the end you know? After I was completely done with you I would've allowed you to leave with him and do whatever you wanted,  but look at this now,  you tried to defy me and now I have to punish you like the bad dog that you are.
<p></p>-Herbert glares at Lyuri with murder in his eyes before going back to struggling against Alexiel's Zoroark.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Grr... <em>you.</em> Come to finish what your miserable apprentice started,  have you?
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> No. I just came here to make sure you fail. Nice isn't it?
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> -still crying- I guess... This is it then? If I try to attack you you're just going to get another Pokémon out to kill me,  so I can only watch as you take him away from me again. I went through all of this just to fail again... Heh... Good job,  you completely fooled me and everyone else,  now why don't you end the one person who knows your plans? I don't care about anything else anymore.
<p></p>-Alexiel then stops for a second as he's walking away,  as if he was stopping to think of something to tell Lyuri-
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> ...Oh,  I don't like killing,  I'm quite against it in fact.
<p></p>-After saying it that,  Alexiel just stood there looking at Lyuri on the ground,  until the silence was broken by Sakura-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Teleport!
<p></p>-Sakura then suddenly appears right next to him and quickly hits him right in the head,  making him stagger and drop the Master Ball,  he glances at the Bisharp and sees that it was taken down by Daisuke,  who was looking quite puzzled by what was going on.-
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> You...! How did you-
<p></p>-Alexiel then moved to pick a Pokéball,  until Sakura started pointing her gun at him before he could do so-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> It's all your fault. If you dare to try to call out another Pokémon,  I'm not going to be afraid to shoot.
<p></p>-Taking advantage of Alexiel's hesitation,  Daisuke quickly uses his psychic powers to get his Pokéballs out of his reach by controlling them through telekinesis,  all whilst standing in a fighting stance-
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> Wait,  wait...! This is not supposed to happen like this,  stop pointing that gun at me! Step back! Do what you're supposed to!
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> ...Are you really asking me to do that?
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> -gulps- What about your friend there? I could have him killed easily there if you shoot me.
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> You just said you don't do any killings,  you could be lying but... It's his problem,  not mine. Not anymore.
<p></p>-Herbert squirms uncomfortably.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Uh... hey,  do I get any say about being used as a bargaining chip?
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> -without even looking at him- Should've thought about <em>that</em> before attempting to kill my sister.
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> S-Sakura...?
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> ...You know,  you're the one with the gun,  I'm just going to let you handle the talks. A gun buys you a lot of diplomatic clout,  after all.
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> You... You're not supposed to act like that... Ugh... It's all his fault for acting out of the script.
<p></p>-Alexiel glances at Herbert,  but then back to Sakura,  starting to regain his composure-
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> Very well. You can keep the Lucario,  I don't really need it anymore as I don't particularly care about Shadow Pokémon,  that's why I gave him to your sister in the first place. It was just a punishment,  one that I'll have to follow some other day.That thing disappointed me as well,  I expected more to it than to be defeated by such a weak Scizor.
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Quit acting like you <em>let</em> us win! In case you hadn't noticed,  she's the one with the gun pointed at you!
<p></p><strong>Alexiel:</strong> Indeed she is,  however now it's time to finish this scene and move on to the next one. See you then!
<p></p>-In a swift movement,  Alexiel throws a Smoke Ball at Sakura and another at Daisuke,  leaving them disoriented enough for him to pick up his Pokéballs and recall his Bisharp as he runs away. His Zoroark soon follows him,  disappearing not long after letting Herbert go-
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> Sakura! Are you all right?!
<p></p>Sakura then moves out of the cloud of smoke,  as does Daisuke,  both coughing a lot.-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> It's just some smoke... -cough- I'll be fine. -cough- -cough-
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> I... I never thought I'd see you using a gun.
<p></p><strong>Daisuke:</strong> &lt;Neither did I,  even less you actually threatening to kill someone with it,  is that really all right?&gt;
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> -sighs and stores the gun back at her bag- ...I'm only going to let myself shoot in emergencies. -turns to Lyuri- Are you all right,  sis?
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> -gives a sad smile- This trip here to Orre really toughened you up,  huh...
<p></p>-Lyuri then hugs Sakura as tight as she could,  so much that it was hard for her to breathe before being let go-
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> I missed being able to do this... So much. -sighs-
<p></p>-There is the sound of someone clearing their throat as Herbert gets to his feet.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> I hate to interrupt this little moment - oh wait,  actually I don't - but how long are you planning on ignoring the Donphan in the room for,  exactly?
<p></p>-Sakura then glares at Herbert-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Just get out,  Herbert. I don't ever want to see you again after what you did here,  even after all that we went through you still tried to kill my sister without even thinking about what I was feeling about it. Just... Just go away already!
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> S-Sakura... Calm down,  you shouldn't be like that! -worried-
<p></p><strong>Daisuke:</strong> &lt;What... Just happened between you three?&gt;
<p></p>-Herbert ignores Daisuke in favour of returning Sakura's glare.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> So this is it? After everything I've been through,  everything I've done for your ungrateful asses,  I don't even get a fucking explanation?
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Don't talk as if I didn't do anything for you either! I helped you whenever I could and this is how you pay me back? I'm surprised that you want an explanation,  because you sure wasn't going to let Lyuri give any before you killed her!
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> Now <em>I'm</em> the ungrateful one? You wouldn't even have rescued Duke if it hadn't been for me! Whilst you were busy hiding in the corner and wetting yourself,  I actually stood up and fought! He'd have killed you if I hadn't stepped in! And for the last time,  I wasn't going to kill her! Now are you going to tell me what the hell's going on here or not?
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> If it hadn't been for me that creep would've escaped with Duke! I helped just as much as you did! You don't even care that I was having my own problems dealing with Duke's corruption do you?!
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> You two... Please stop that now... Please... -feeling immensely guilty-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> What I care about is the fact that you two are stabbing me in the back without having even the basic decency to tell me what the fuck is going on!
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> You also stabbed me in the back the moment you attacked Lyuri like that! And it's not like you care about an explanation,  because I'm more than sure that you would only make things even worse for her just like you did back in Lacunosa,  since apparently trying to understand what others are feeling about something is too alien for you to comprehend!
<p></p>-Herbert has no response but to glare at Sakura with murder in his eyes. For a moment it looks as though he is ready to start strangling someone again,  but when he speaks,  his tone is eerily calm.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> ...Fine. I don't need a pair of traitors like the two of you anyway.
<p></p>-Before either Sakura or Lyuri can intervene,  he strides across the warehouse and snatches Duke's Master Ball from where it fell,  recalling the unconscious Bishop as he does.-
<p></p><strong>Herbert:</strong> <em>I'm</em> taking Duke with me,  though. Because unlike you two,  I actually give a <em>damn</em> about trying to save him.
<p></p>-He turns and marches towards the door,  pausing only to give Sakura and Lyuri one last glare - this one not conveying hatred,  but rather betrayal. Sakura returns the same glare,  but once he's gone she looks at Lyuri-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> Should we... Take Duke back from him?
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> I... I don't want to have to Duke as a Shadow Pokémon,  not anymore... -sighs- ... I have a lot to explain... This is all my fault,  I didn't want any of this to happen but... -looks about to cry-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> We can talk about this later,  for now... Let's just head back,  even if everybody goes against you once they find out about it,  I'm still going to be at your side. -gently smiles-
<p></p><strong>Lyuri:</strong> Thanks sis,  really. -hugs her again-
<p></p><strong>Daisuke:</strong> -looking worried- &lt;Sakura?&gt;
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong> -hugging Lyuri back- Yes?
<p></p><strong>Daisuke:</strong> &lt;What happened with you? You do realize you just threatened to shoot someone,  right?&gt;
<p></p>-Sakura gets puzzled for a few seconds,  but it quickly dawns on her what Daisuke meant,  she gives a sad sigh in response-
<p></p><strong>Sakura:</strong>... I I just acted on instinct and That scares me as well...
<p></p><strong>Daisuke:</strong> &lt;All right... Let's head out of here for now,  both of you need some rest after what happened here.&gt;
<p></p>-Sakura and Lyuri nod and then Daisuke teleports them and himself away-
